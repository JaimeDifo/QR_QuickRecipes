 Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.
 Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.
 Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¬º cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6‚Äì8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.

Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.
 Place chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155¬∞F, 45‚Äì55 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160¬∞F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.

19,Roasted Beets With Crispy Sunchokes and Pickled Orange-Ginger Pur√©e,"['Strips of zest (no pith) from 1 medium orange', '2¬Ω ounces fresh ginger (about one 5-inch piece), peeled and thinly shaved (use a mandoline if you have one)', '¬º cup fresh lime juice', '¬º cup champagne vinegar', '¬º cup sugar', '2 tablespoons plus ¬æ teaspoon kosher salt', '2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', '¬Ω Thai chile, with seeds', '1¬Ω pounds beets (use a mix of colors if possible), about 5 medium', '¬º cup extra-virgin olive oil', '¬º cup white wine vinegar', '¬º cup water', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil', '¬Ω cup roughly chopped cashews', '4 large sunchokes, thinly shaved (use a mandoline if you have one)', 'Vegetable oil', 'Kosher salt', '1 medium orange', 'Roasted Beets', 'Extra-virgin olive oil', 'Kosher salt', '¬º cup Pickled Orange-Ginger Puree', 'Toasted Cashews', '1 tablespoon roughly chopped tarragon', '1 tablespoon roughly chopped dill fronds', 'Sunchoke Chips']","Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and ¬æ teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.
 Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)
 Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.
 In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
 Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about ¬Ω cup.)
 Using a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.

22,Chhena Poda (Spiced Cheesecake),"['Ghee, for the cake pan', '8 ounces paneer, preferably homemade', '¬º cup confectioners‚Äô sugar', '¬Ω teaspoon ground cardamom', '2 tablespoons semolina', '1¬Ω tablespoons ghee, store-bought or homemade', '¬º cup whole milk', '2 tablespoons roasted cashews', '2 tablespoons golden raisins', '3 tablespoons granulated sugar', 'Freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds (optional)', 'for serving']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee.
 In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners‚Äô sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside.
 Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so don‚Äôt let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but don‚Äôt touch it‚Äîjust let it caramelize on its own.) You will know it‚Äôs ready for the cake batter when it‚Äôs bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesn‚Äôt, use the spatula to create a smooth surface.
 Wearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake‚Äôs edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over‚Äîit should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan‚Äîthis is fine).
 Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
 Note: To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar sticking to the surface of the pan before cleaning it."
23,Paneer,"['2 quarts whole milk', 'Juice of 2 lemons', '¬Ω teaspoon kosher salt']","In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195¬∞F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.
 Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don‚Äôt fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don‚Äôt panic if this hasn‚Äôt happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.
 Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days."
24,Sloppy Joe Shirred Eggs With Spinach,"['1 medium carrot, top removed and cut into about 6 pieces', '1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, or 2 scant cups roughly chopped fresh tomatoes', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided', '3 garlic cloves, minced', '8 ounces fresh spinach (4 cups packed)', '3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided', '1 pound ground turkey', '2 teaspoons ground cumin', '1 teaspoon smoked paprika', '¬Ω teaspoon ground black pepper', '¬Ω cup R-Rated Onions', '2 tablespoons red wine vinegar', '4 large eggs Parmigiano Reggiano', 'for serving (optional)']","Preheat your oven to 400¬∞F. Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till it‚Äôs as smooth as your blender allows.
 In an ovenproof 12-inch saut√© pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and ¬Ω teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.
 Add the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds.
 Add the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and ¬Ω teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like.
 Turn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
 Slide the skillet onto the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly runny.
 To serve, scatter ribbons of Parmigiano Reggiano or another hard cheese over the top. If bread is your thing, this is great with toast."
25,R-Rated Onions,"['4‚Äì5 large or 6‚Äì8 medium yellow or white onions', '1 Tbsp olive or vegetable oil', '1 tsp kosher salt']","Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends‚Äîlongways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.
 Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don‚Äôt have to stand over it like risotto, but don‚Äôt go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that‚Äôs good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don‚Äôt rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized
 About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a ¬Ω cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you‚Äôre smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you‚Äôre done.
 Note: R-Rated Onions will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 3 months."

Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside.
 Heat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot. Add the sugar and swirl in the pot, stirring constantly; allow it to caramelize to a dark brown color. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

 Stir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper.
 Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or ""cheese"" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute. Butternut squash will also work, although it will be slightly less sweet."

36,Creole Cream Cheesecake With Caramel-Apple Topping,"['2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 16 whole crackers)', '3 tablespoons granulated sugar', '3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar', '1‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon kosher salt', '1‚ÅÑ2 cup unsalted butter, melted', '2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature', '1 cup granulated sugar', '1‚Öì cups Creole Cream Cheese', '1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste', '2 eggs, at room temperature', 'Ingredient Info: You can substitute 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1‚ÅÑ4 cup buttermilk for the 1‚Öì cups Creole Cream Cheese.', '3¬æ tablespoons unsalted butter', '3‚ÅÑ4 cup granulated sugar', '1‚ÅÑ4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar', '1¬Ω tablespoons honey', '4 cups peeled, cored, and evenly chopped Granny Smith apples (about 7)', '1¬Ω teaspoons finely grated lemon zest', '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice', '3‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon kosher salt', '3‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1‚ÅÑ3 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1‚ÅÑ3 teaspoon ground ginger', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract']","Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.
 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won‚Äôt look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.
 Decrease the oven temperature to 350¬∞F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don‚Äôt panic‚Äîit‚Äôll still be delicious, and you‚Äôll do better next time!
 Let the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don‚Äôt want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you‚Äôre worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you‚Äôll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.
 In a large heavy-bottomed saut√© pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator."
37,Creole Cream Cheese,"['2 quarts skim milk', '1‚ÅÑ4 cup buttermilk', '1 rennet tablet']","In a large heavy-bottomed saucepot over medium heat with a kitchen thermometer attached to the rim, warm the milk and buttermilk to 85¬∞F. Add one-quarter of the rennet tablet and transfer the mixture to a plastic container or bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and then poke a few holes in the plastic to allow the steam to escape. Let stand at room temperature in a cool spot in your house for 48 hours.
 Use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a double layer of cheesecloth set over a bowl and discard the liquid. Wrap the solids in the cheesecloth and hang it over the bowl (to catch the whey) in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
 Discard the whey. Pack the cheese into an airtight plastic container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
38,Buss Up Shut (Paratha Roti),"['2¬º tsp. nonfat dry milk powder', '2 tsp. baking powder', '2 tsp. granulated sugar or light brown sugar', '2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more', '2 Tbsp. vegetable shortening, room temperature', '1 Tbsp. ghee', 'unsalted butter', 'or vegan butter', 'room temperature']","Whisk milk powder, baking powder, granulated sugar, and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of ¬æ cup warm water (110¬∞) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)
 Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.
 Meanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.
 Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.
 Roll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6""‚Äìdiameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a ¬æ"" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don‚Äôt need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.
 Heat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.
 Meanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a ‚Öõ""-thick round, about 10‚Äì12"".
 Brush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that‚Äôs okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1‚Äì2 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go."

Reduce heat to low and cook eggs, covered completely, 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking and let stand 5 minutes.
 Peel eggs and halve lengthwise. Carefully remove yolks and mash in a bowl with a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard, and cayenne and stir with fork until smooth, then season with salt and pepper. Fill pastry bag with yolk mixture and pipe into egg whites."
40,Mango Curry,"['2 green, unripe mangoes, peeled and sliced (2 cups)', '4 shallots, thinly sliced (about ¬Ω cup)', '4 Indian or Thai green chiles, halved lengthwise', '1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks', '3 cloves garlic, cut into thin matchsticks', '3 Tbsp coconut vinegar or white vinegar', '1¬Ω tsp salt', '3 cups coconut milk', '1 Tbsp coconut oil', '1¬Ω tsp black mustard seeds', '4 dried red chiles, snapped in half', '20 curry leaves', 'Fried Onions for garnish (optional)', 'Basmati Rice to serve']","In a bowl, combine mangoes, shallots, green chiles, ginger, garlic, vinegar, and salt and mix well. Set aside for 2 hours.
 In a large saucepan, combine mango mixture and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until mangoes are softened.
 Have a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles and curry leaves and cook for 15‚Äì20 seconds. Add the tempered spice mixture to the saucepan and stir to combine.
 Garnish with fried onions (if using). Serve with rice.
 Tempering is a traditional method of extracting optimal flavor from Indian spices, and it is a skill learned with practice! Reducing the heat a little before adding the spices prevents the spices from burning and adding a bitterness to your dish. If they do burn, simply start again with fresh spices."

42,Pumpkin Dutch Baby With Pumpkin Butter,"['3 large eggs, room temperature', '1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin pur√©e, divided', '1 cup milk, room temperature', '3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, divided', '1 cup all-purpose flour', '1 ¬Ω tsp. cinnamon, divided', '¬º tsp. allspice', '¬º tsp. ground ginger', '¬º tsp. nutmeg', 'Kosher salt', '¬Ω cup apple cider or juice', '3 Tbsp. maple syrup', 'Powdered sugar', 'for serving']","Place an 8-inch ovenproof skillet or cast-iron pan in the oven and preheat to 425¬∞.
 Once the oven reaches temperature, blend 3 large eggs in a blender until well combined and frothy, 1 minute. Add ¬º cup of the pumpkin pur√©e, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¬º tsp. allspice, ¬º tsp. ground ginger, ¬º tsp. nutmeg, ¬Ω tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition. Blend again until combined and frothy, 1 minute (scraping down the sides of the blender if necessary).
 Pull the hot pan from the oven and add the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, swirling the pan so it melts evenly across the bottom (it will bubble and brown). Once the butter is melted, immediately pour in the Dutch baby batter and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown and slightly puffed, 20 minutes.
 While the Dutch baby bakes, combine ¬Ω cup apple cider, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, the remaining ¬Ω tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the rest of the can of pumpkin pur√©e (about 1 ¬º cups) in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides of the pot with a spatula, until dark and thickened with no raw pumpkin flavor remaining, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice the Dutch baby (it will start to sink as soon as you take it out of the oven) and serve with the pumpkin butter and powdered sugar."
43,Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel,"['4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3¬Ω lb.), patted dry', '4¬Ω tsp. kosher salt, divided', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '2 medium fennel bulbs (about 1 lb.), plus ¬º cup coarsely chopped fronds', '1 lb. Red Flame or green table grapes, stems removed (about 2 cups)', '1 cup unsalted chicken broth', '¬º cup honey', '4 tsp. Calabrian chile paste or chopped Calabrian chiles', '1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375¬∞F. Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt.
 Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.
 Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice ¬Ω"" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last ¬º"" (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, ¬Ω tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside.
 Reduce heat to medium and combine broth, honey, chile paste, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in reserved pot. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. Place remaining grapes in pot and arrange chicken legs, skin side up and overlapping if needed, over grapes. Top with dressed fennel and grapes. (Don‚Äôt worry if it looks crowded: Fennel will soften as it cooks.)
 Transfer pot, uncovered, to oven and roast until fennel is slightly softened, with some crispy, caramelized edges, grapes on top are swollen and browned in spots, and chicken is cooked through, 30‚Äì40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
 Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer grapes and fennel to a bowl and chicken to a platter. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring braising liquid to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half (you should have about 1 cup liquid), 8‚Äì10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar and fennel fronds.

44,Old-Fashioned Scalloped Potatoes,"['2 cups thinly sliced onion', '9 tablespoons unsalted butter', '6 tablespoons all-purpose flour', '3 1/2 cups milk', '2 1/2 pounds boiling potatoes', '1 1/2 cups coarsely grated sharp Cheddar (about 6 ounces)', '1/3 cup dry bread crumbs']","Preheat oven to 400¬∞. In a skillet, cook the onion and 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is very soft. In a heavy saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of the remaining butter over moderately low heat, whisk in the flour, and cook the roux, whisking, for 3 minutes. Add the milk, scalded, in a stream, whisking, and bring the sauce to a boil. Simmer the sauce, whisking, for 1 minute and add salt and pepper to taste.
 Peel the potatoes and slice them ‚Öõ-inch thick. Spread about one third of the sauce in the bottom of a well-buttered 3-quart gratin dish at least 2 ¬Ω-inches deep, cover it with a layer of potato slices, overlapping the slices slightly, and cover the potatoes with one third of the onions. Sprinkle the onions with one third of the Cheddar and continue to layer the remaining sauce, potatoes, onions, and Cheddar in the same manner. Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs, and dot it with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits.
 Bake the mixture, covered with foil, in the middle of preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake the potato mixture for 35 minutes more, or until the top is golden and the potatoes are tender."
45,Yogurt and Spice Roasted Salmon,"['500g skinless salmon fillet, cut into 4cm cubes', '4 tablespoons Greek yogurt', '1 tablespoon garlic granules', '1 heaped tablespoon rose harissa', '1 teaspoon ground turmeric', '1 teaspoon paprika', 'Finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lime and a good squeeze of juice', '1 teaspoon olive oil', 'Generous amount of Maldon sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper', 'Tortilla wraps', 'Sliced tomatoes', 'Finely sliced onion', 'Coriander leaves', 'Greek yogurt']","Preheat your oven to its highest setting (with fan if it has one).

46,Pita,"['1¬Ω cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4¬Ω cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3¬Ω teaspoons Morton kosher salt']","Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.
 Reserve ¬Ω cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.
 If you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you‚Äôre making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
 With your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining ¬Ω cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.
 Flour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.
 Lightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.
 After 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.
 Repeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it‚Äôs ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it‚Äôs shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.
 Wipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don‚Äôt deflate all the air inside.
 Lightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of ‚Äúcage‚Äù around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.
 Space the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn‚Äôt dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they‚Äôre pillowy.
 Meanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You‚Äôre emulating a 700¬∞F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.
 When the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don‚Äôt manhandle it or you‚Äôll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.
 With firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it‚Äôs about 6 inches across.
 This next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions‚Äîscreaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you‚Äôre giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don‚Äôt turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it‚Äî it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it‚Äôs still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.
 Use tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.
 Bake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature."
47,Veselka's Famous Borscht,"['3 pounds (10 to 12) small beets, scrubbed thoroughly but not peeled', '9 tablespoons white vinegar', 'One 2-pound boneless pork butt, halved', '8 cups beef, chicken, or vegetable stock', '1 bay leaf', '1 teaspoon whole allspice berries', '1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns', '3 large carrots, peeled and sliced', '3 large celery stalks, sliced', '1 small head of green cabbage (about ¬æ to 1 pound), shredded (about 4 cups)', '2 medium Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into ¬Ω-inch dice', 'One 15-ounce can lima beans, drained and rinsed', 'Salt']","To make the ‚Äúbeet water,‚Äù roughly chop 2 pounds of the beets (select the smaller ones), preferably in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
 Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
 Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
 Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
 When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
 To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ¬Ω-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.
 To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.
 To compose the soup, in a large soup pot combine the ‚Äúbeet water‚Äù and meat broth with the vegetables. Add the cubed pork and the grated beets. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over low heat. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately."

Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.
 Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6‚Äì8 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.)
 Toast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won‚Äôt completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay‚Äîyou just want to release some of their flavor.
 Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20‚Äì25 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.
 Add tomato pur√©e to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30‚Äì40 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.
 Spoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a ¬º"" layer of oil on top.
 Do ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
 Note: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot‚Äîsome West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don‚Äôt like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range. West African pantry staples can be found at Zoe's Ghana Kitchen."
50,Summer Bean Soup With Tomato Brown Butter,"['8 oz. (230 g) dried beans, such as flageolet or navy, or fresh shelling beans', '2 in. square dried kombu', '2 large tomatoes', '2 celery ribs', '1 carrot', '1 leek, white and light green parts only', '6 shallots, skins intact', '6 garlic cloves, minced', '4 oil-packed anchovy fillets', '6 Tbsp. (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil', '2 Tbsp. maple syrup', '1 ¬Ω Tbsp. kosher salt', '1 Tbsp. red pepper flakes', '1 tsp. whole-grain mustard', '8 oz. (230 g) bacon', '8 oz. (230 g) Romano beans or green beans, chopped into 1 in. pieces', '2 shallots, thinly sliced', '1 tsp. red pepper flakes', 'Zest and juice of 1 lemon', '1 garlic clove, grated', '12 pickled green beans (see Basic Wet Salt Method, below)', '9 cherry tomatoes, quartered', '2 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp. sherry vinegar', 'Tomato Brown Butter', 'Crumbled feta', 'parsley leaves', 'and marjoram leaves for garnish']","Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans.
 Drain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.
 Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.
 Set up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.
 In a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Pur√©e until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you‚Äôre ready to serve.
 While the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Cut the bacon into ¬º in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.
 In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.
 Increase the heat slightly, and saut√© the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.
 Thinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.
 To serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it‚Äôs made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.
 This works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you‚Äôre adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don‚Äôt have an airlock, you‚Äôll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60¬∞F to 68¬∞F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely."
51,Tomato Brown Butter,"['1 large tomato (about 8 oz. or 230 g)', '¬Ω cup (120 g) unsalted butter', 'Kosher salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper']","Place the tomato in a blender and pur√©e, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve; you should get about ¬Ω cup (120 ml). Add the butter to a large skillet and gently cook over medium heat until it starts to brown and smell nutty. Stir in the smooth tomato pur√©e (be careful; it might spatter) and simmer for another minute or so. You‚Äôre looking to slightly cook the pur√©e but keep its brightness. The mix won‚Äôt emulsify, which is fine. Season with salt and pepper and set aside."
52,Maple-Roasted Acorn Squash,"['3 acorn squash, unpeeled, halved through the stem, and seeded', '3 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced', '3 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus extra for serving', 'Good olive oil', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'Flaked sea salt', 'such as Maldon', 'for serving']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.
 Place the squash, cut sides up, on a sheet pan. Place ¬Ω tablespoon butter and ¬Ω tablespoon maple syrup in the cavity of each squash. Brush the cut sides with olive oil and sprinkle the squash with 3 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Roast for 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the squash, until tender when pierced with a small knife.
 Place the squash on a serving platter. If the halves are too large for one serving, cut each piece in half through the stem. Drizzle lightly with extra maple syrup, sprinkle with sea salt, and serve hot.
 Acorn squash is hard to cut. To halve a whole squash, plunge the blade of a large chef‚Äôs knife into the side of the squash as far as it will go. Holding the handle of the knife, bang the squash (with the knife in it) on the board until the blade cuts all the way through."

Season with salt.
 Do Ahead: Yogurt can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
 Rinse lentils, then soak in 2 cups water at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. (Soaking the lentils makes them tender and a lot easier to blend.)
 Meanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2"" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into ¬º""-thick planks. Stack a few planks and slice lengthwise into ¬º""-thick matchsticks (about the size of a skinny french fry). Transfer zucchini to a colander set in a medium bowl.

 Working one at a time, set potatoes on a flat surface and crush slightly with the palm of your hand. Add to bowl with dressing along with ¬º cup potato cooking liquid. Do this while the potatoes are still warm so that they can absorb all of the seasoning. Don't worry if the dressing looks a little loose and watery at the beginning‚Äîit will all get absorbed and become creamier as it sits. Taste and season with more salt or, if your dressing looks too thick, a splash of potato cooking liquid.
 Top potatoes with remaining chives and reserved onion and crumble potato chips over."

Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.
 Make the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add ‚Öì cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.
 One at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.
 Add the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about ‚Öì cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
 Spread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.
 Let the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before slicing. Dipping a thin knife into hot water between each cut, slice the cake into wedges and serve, topping each serving with freshly grated lemon zest."

70,Swiss Chard Pasta With Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan,"['¬º cup hazelnuts', '1 pound bow tie pasta (farfalle)', '8 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more if needed', '4 cloves of garlic, minced', 'Hefty pinch each of salt and freshly ground black pepper', 'Small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', '1 bunch Swiss chard, stems finely chopped and greens thinly sliced', '4 ounces Parmesan cheese, shaved', '2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (optional)']","Add the hazelnuts to a small skillet over medium heat. Toast them slowly, shaking the pan often, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.
 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.
 In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.
 Pour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.
 Set the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.
 Add the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you‚Äôre using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.
 Serve warm or at room temperature.
 Localize it: You can use kale instead of chard, and any nut will work in place of the hazelnuts. Fresh out of balsamic vinegar? Red wine vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice will work."
71,Sweet Corn Frittata With Cherry Tomato Compote,"['2 tablespoons olive oil', '2 cloves of garlic, minced', '2 cups cherry tomatoes (any variety will work)', '¬º cup dry white wine', '8 to 10 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced', 'Healthy pinch of fine sea salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '2 tablespoons cooking fat', '1 bunch of scallions, white parts and green parts diced separately', '2 cloves of garlic, minced', '1 medium potato, scrubbed and cut into 1/4-inch chunks', '2 cups fresh or thawed frozen corn kernels', '4 large eggs', '¬Ω teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes', '4 ounces feta cheese', 'crumbled']","Heat the oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes longer. Pour in the wine and cook until the wine is reduced by about half. Add the basil, salt, and pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes burst and become fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside the tomatoes in a bowl.
 Position an oven rack about 3 inches from the top and preheat the broiler.
 In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the diced white part of the scallions and the minced garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the potato and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the potato softens, about 10 minutes. Add the corn and continue to cook for about 2 minutes longer.
 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, red pepper flakes, and half the feta cheese. Pour the egg mixture over the veggie mixture in the skillet and top with the remainder of the cheese. Stir in the potato mixture and the scallion greens.
 Wipe out the skillet and, over medium-high, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of cooking fat. Cook the frittata, lifting up the cooked egg around the edges with a rubber spatula to let the uncooked eggs flow underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, giving the pan a shake now and again, until the eggs are mostly set but the center is still slightly jiggly, 3 to 5 minutes more.
 Transfer the frittata to the oven and broil until the top is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes (keep a close eye on the frittata, as it can easily burn). Serve topped with the tomato compote."
72,Tomato Pie With Sour Cream Crust,"['2 cups all-purpose flour, plus a little extra for dusting', '¬Ω teaspoon salt', '2 teaspoons dried parsley', '13 tablespoons (1 stick plus 5 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced', '6 tablespoons sour cream or plain full-fat yogurt', '1 tablespoon white wine vinegar', '¬º cup ice water', '2 tablespoons cooking fat', '1 large onion, thinly sliced', '2¬º pounds mixed heirloom tomatoes (mix of full size and cherries)', '¬æ cup hard salty cheese, such as Manchego or Parmesan', '¬æ cup shredded mozzarella cheese', '¬º cup mayonnaise', '3 tablespoons chopped basil leaves', '3 tablespoons chopped parsley', '1 teaspoon chopped thyme', 'Salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 egg, beaten', '1 tablespoon milk', 'cream', 'or water']","Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.
 In a large, wide bowl, combine the flour, salt, and parsley. Add the butter pieces and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut them up and into the flour mixture until it resembles little pebbles. Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.
 In a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.
 In a large skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool.
 Meanwhile, thinly slice the tomatoes; toss them with 1 teaspoon salt and let them drain in a colander for 30 minutes, tossing them occasionally.
 In a bowl, combine the cheeses, mayo, 2 tablespoons each of the chopped basil and parsley, the thyme, a hefty pinch each of salt and pepper, and the saut√©ed onion.
 Sprinkle a little flour in the bottom of a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Set it aside.
 On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the prepared skillet, allowing the edges to extend over the sides of the pan.
 Spread the cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the dough. Arrange the tomatoes on top. Gently fold the overhanging pie crust over the tomatoes. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect.
 Drizzle the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking fat and season with pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush the crust with this egg wash, place the cast-iron pan on a rimmed baking sheet (to protect the bottom of your oven from any overflowing filling), and bake the pie until the tomatoes are browned, 50 to 60 minutes. Top the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon each basil and parsley.
 Localize it: Swap out any of the herbs or cheeses. The Manchego in this recipe is salty, and the mozzarella melts really well, so just keep that in mind when you‚Äôre doing your swaps."

Remove escab√®che from heat and stir in oregano.
 Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in reserved skillet over high. Arrange pork chops in pan so bone ends are in the center (this part cooks slower and this will help with even browning) and press down on pork chops with tongs to ensure surface is making good contact with the pan. Cook until golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn pork chops over and press down on them again. Transfer to oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130¬∞ for medium (you should still have a little pink flesh; temperature should rise to about 145¬∞ when the pork chops rest), 5‚Äì7 minutes.

If using charcoal and your coals are dying, start a new chimney of coals 15 minutes before this point so you are ready for the next step.
 Uncover grill and increase heat to high (add more coals for a charcoal grill). Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160¬∞ and thickest part of thighs registers 165¬∞, 10‚Äì15 minutes longer.
 If using an oven, place a rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350¬∞. Place chicken, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush one third of basting liquid over skin. Bake, rotating baking sheet every 10 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast and thighs registers 130¬∞‚Äì140¬∞, 35‚Äì40 minutes.
 Increase oven temperature to 450¬∞. Brush remaining basting liquid over skin and continue to bake, rotating baking sheet halfway through, until skin is crisp and charred and thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160¬∞ and thickest part of thighs registers 165¬∞, 10‚Äì15 minutes longer.
 Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest at least 15 minutes. Carve up further as desired.
 Top dipping sauce with cilantro. Serve chicken with rice and dipping sauce alongside.
 If you cook the chicken in the oven, using the dhungar method to perfume the finished chicken with the scent of smoky ghee is highly recommended."

 Whisk all-purpose flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and rub and smash into dry ingredients with your fingers to create large, shaggy pieces (you want some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and irregular).
 Drizzle egg yolk mixture over flour and, using a fork or your fingers, toss into dough to incorporate. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry; although, if it looks too dry and doesn't come together, add 1‚Äì2 Tbsp. more water, but only if needed).
 Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times. Divide dough in half, stack pieces, and press down firmly to smash together. Repeat process until dough is well combined and becomes slightly sticky, 2‚Äî3 more times. Press dough into bottom and 1"" up sides of pan and prick all over with a fork.

82,Melted Broccoli Pasta With Capers and Anchovies,"['Kosher salt', '2 heads (about 1 pound, or 454g, total) broccoli, cut into bitesize florets', '12 ounces (340 g) whole-wheat penne pasta, or other short tubular pasta', '3 tablespoons (45 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '1 cup (54 g) panko or Freezer Bread Crumbs (see Note)', '4 oil-packed anchovy fillets', '¬º cup (36 g) capers, chopped if large (rinsed well if salt-packed)', '2 garlic cloves, minced', '¬º teaspoon red pepper flakes']","Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli florets and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to a large bowl.
 Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes.
 Meanwhile, toast the bread crumbs. Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil in a large, high-sided saut√© pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and saut√© until the crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
 Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the pan. Add the anchovies and saut√© until they disintegrate, about 1 minute. Add the capers, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Saut√© until fragrant, about 1 minute, and remove from the heat.
 When the pasta is ready, reserve 1¬Ω cups (360 ml) of pasta water with a measuring cup, then drain the pasta. Add the broccoli and reserved pasta water to the pan and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, using a wooden spoon to break the florets into small pieces as they become more tender, until the water is reduced by about half and you've been able to break apart enough florets that you're left with a very chunky mixture, 5 to 7 minutes.
 Add the pasta to the pan. Cook, tossing and stirring, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add half the toasted bread crumbs, and toss again to combine. Serve garnished with the remaining toasted bread crumbs."
83,Dashi,"['1 gallon cold water', '1 (6-inch) square dashima (kombu)', '3 medium dried shiitake mushrooms', '12 large dried anchovies (gutted and heads removed)']","Put the water, dashima, shiitake mushrooms, and anchovies in a covered stockpot or other large pot and let stand at room temperature overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.
 Remove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.
 Strain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.
 It‚Äôs best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.
 Vegetarians can make a dashi from just dashima and dried shiitakes."
84,Ginger and Tamarind Refresher,"['2¬Ω cups (600 ml) water', '2¬Ω oz (70 g) sour tamarind pulp or paste', '8 oz (225 g) fresh ginger, preferably young', '1 cup (200 g) sugar', 'One 1 L bottle chilled club soda or 4 cups (960 ml) chilled water']","Bring 1¬Ω cups (360 ml) of the water to a boil. Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.
 Rinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.
 In a large pitcher, mix the tamarind extract and the ginger simple syrup together. Fill eight tall glasses with ice. Pour 4 oz (120 ml) of the tamarind-ginger syrup into each glass, top with 4 oz (120 ml) of the club soda or chilled water, and stir. Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
 This rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It‚Äôs wonderful during the warmer months. Young ginger requires no peeling before use because its outer skin is so thin. I recommend using South Asian tamarind, which is a lot more sour than the Mexican variety. Look for it in Asian and Indian markets."
85,Sumac and Saffron Refresher,"['15 to 20 saffron strands, plus a few extra strands for garnish', '¬Ω cup (100 g) sugar', '3 green cardamom pods, smashed', '¬º cup (30 g) ground sumac', '3 cups (700 ml) chilled club soda or water']","Grind the saffron with 2 Tbsp. of sugar to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.
 In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup (240 ml) water, sugar, cardamom, and powdered saffron mixture and bring to simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.
 To serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
 Sumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis."

Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 3 minutes. (If, at any time during the cooking process, the items in the pan dry out at all, deglaze the pan with some lime juice, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, and continue.) Turn the heat to medium and add the chiles. Cook for 10 minutes, or until the chiles are thoroughly cooked.
 At this point, warm a separate frying pan over medium heat and add the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Interleaved with finishing the rest of the recipe, heat each tortilla in the oil-coated pan for about 20 seconds per side, just long enough to make them the slightest bit golden but still pliable, and put between two towels to stay warm and wick away any excess oil.
 Once the chiles have cooked for 10 minutes, pour the lime juice on the ingredients in the pan. Add the diced bacon to the pan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the pan has heated up and the bacon has started to turn color, add the shrimp and use the salt to season everything in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and flipping the shrimp as necessary to cook them evenly. The shrimp should be bright pink and white and opaque. If they are still translucent, cook them a little longer.
 Sprinkle the cheese over everything in the pan and turn the heat to low. Continue stirring until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the heat. Distribute the cheesy shrimp mixture equally among the tortillas, making a plate full of tacos. Serve along with the lime wedges and red salsa, if desired."

 Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 1¬Ω"" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you‚Äôve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165¬∞F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2¬Ω tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.
 To make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1¬Ω tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.
 Trim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin‚Äîabout ‚Öõ inch/3mm away‚Äîbut not so close that it tears and won‚Äôt hold its shape when it‚Äôs stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don‚Äôt need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife‚Äîbe sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!
 Use the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about ‚Öõ inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about ¬Ω inch/1cm from the end intact‚Äîthey need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.
 Using your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about ¬Ω inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.
 Gently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won‚Äôt fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft‚Äîtest if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don‚Äôt worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.
 To make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don‚Äôt want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside‚Äîit will crisp up as it cools down‚Äîand return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.
 When the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha‚Äîthe coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic‚Äîthen sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion. Serve warm or at room temperature, with the yogurt spooned alongside."

 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350¬∞F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside.
 Lightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining ¬Ω cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly.
 Stir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes.
 Transfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use.
 Cut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted.
 Remove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you can‚Äôt achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving.
 To serve, run a knife or offset spatula around edge of pan to release. Unmold and remove parchment paper; discard. Transfer cake to a platter, smooth sides with an offset spatula, and freeze 10 minutes. Slice with a warm knife, wiping off between cuts."

Season all over with 1 Tbsp. salt, then rub with spice mixture, packing it on. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours or chill, uncovered, up to 2 days.
 Bring chiles, vinegar, butter, and sugar to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved and sauce is reduced by about a third, about 5 minutes. Season with salt; cover and keep warm over low heat until ready to use.
 Prepare a grill for medium heat. Drizzle pork all over with oil, then grill, turning every 5 minutes or so, until extremely, gorgeously browned and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 120¬∞F, 35‚Äì45 minutes. Continue to grill, brushing with sauce and turning not quite every minute (you‚Äôre going to see flare-ups, but don‚Äôt worry), until pork is glazed and shiny and temperature on thermometer has risen to 130¬∞F, 5‚Äì10 minutes more. Transfer pork to a platter and let rest 30 minutes; reserve remaining sauce.
 Transfer pork to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices on platter into reserved sauce. Return sauce to a simmer. Slice pork against the grain ¬º"" thick. Arrange on platter, spoon some sauce over, and season with salt. Serve remaining sauce alongside.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 10‚Äì15 minutes. (You should have about 6 Tbsp.) Transfer back to measuring glass and chill until cold, about 30 minutes.
 Mix condensed milk, almond extract, and remaining ¬æ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine.
 Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.
 Add a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage‚Äîfolding‚Äîis easier). Add remaining whipped cream; fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain.

116,Bibingkang Cassava (Cassava Cake),"['4 egg yolks, beaten', 'One 1-lb (500 g) package frozen grated cassava, thawed', '1 cup (250 g) jarred macapuno coconut strings, or sweetened shredded coconut', '1¬Ω cups (375 ml) canned unsweetened coconut milk', '¬Ω cup (125 ml) sweetened condensed milk', '4 egg whites', '¬º cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.
 To make the cake, combine the egg yolks, cassava, macapuno (or shredded coconut, if using), coconut milk and the ¬Ω cup sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl and mix well.
 Pour the cake batter into a greased 8 x 8-in (20 x 20-cm) cake pan. The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but don‚Äôt worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45‚Äì60 minutes.
 Meanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the ¬º cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, don‚Äôt be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined.
 Remove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more.
 Remove the cake from the oven and rest the cake in its pan on a cooling rack. Cool the cake completely before cutting it into squares. The cassava cake can be served at room temperature, or cold out of the refrigerator."
117,Peach Cobbler,"['10 large peaches (about 4¬Ω pounds), unpeeled, cut into 1-inch chunks', 'Zest and juice of 1 large lemon', '¬Ω cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened', '2 cups sugar, divided', '1¬Ω cups (about 192 grams) all-purpose flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '¬æ cup whole milk', '¬Ω cup hot tap water', 'Heavy cream', 'for serving']","Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
 Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.
 In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1¬Ω cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
 Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it‚Äôs no more than about ¬Ω inch thick in any one place.
 Sprinkle the remaining ¬Ω cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It‚Äôs a strange method, but it works.)
 Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry‚Äîbe sure to check in a few places.)
 Let the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top."
118,Pajeon (Ìåå Ï†Ñ / Scallion Pancakes),"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '¬Ω cup cornstarch', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1 teaspoon doenjang (Korean fermentedsoybean paste)', '¬Ω teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '2 cups ice-cold club soda', '1 medium egg yolk', '2 teaspoons minced garlic', '3 bunches scallions, cut into 2-inch batons (if the scallions are thick, cut the white parts lengthwise in half before cutting into batons)', 'About 5 tablespoons grape seed or canola oil, for frying', 'Pajeon Sauce']","To make the batter, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, doenjang, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix well to blend. Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.
 When you‚Äôre ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.
 Set a 10-inch nonstick saut√© pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don‚Äôt want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200¬∞F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it‚Äôs best to eat them right away.
 Cut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine)."
119,Pajeon Sauce,"['2 tablespoons water', '2 tablespoons rice vinegar', '6 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes)', '2 garlic cloves, minced', '¬º teaspoon minced ginger', '1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil', 'Sliced fresh red chile', 'optional']","Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

120,Shaak-no Sambharo (Quick Pickled Vegetables),"['‚Öì cup vegetable oil', '4 Tbsp. whole black mustard seeds (or 4 tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed mustard seeds)', '3 Tbsp. whole fenugreek seeds (or 3 Tbsp. store-bought coarsely crushed fenugreek)', '1 tsp. asafetida powder', '1 Tbsp. ground cayenne (to taste) or 1 large serrano pepper, deseeded, and sliced thin', '‚Öì cup julienned ginger (optional, see Pre-Prep below)', '2-4 Tbsp. white vinegar', '2 tsp. kosher salt (optional)', '2 cups mixed vegetables', 'prepped as follows']","Pre-Prep: Trim fresh vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, radish, and others into bite sized pieces, and no larger than the container they will be stored in. Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.
 If using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.
 Method: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.
 To Store: Use smaller (4 ‚Äì 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two. Serve using a clean and dry fork or spoon for each serving to avoid contamination."

Using a muslin cloth or strainer, extract and remove as much of the onion juice as possible. Rinse once after done and squeeze any remaining water away from the onions. Spread the onions onto a paper towel for 5 minutes.
 Mix all remaining ingredients in a large bowl until well combined. Stir carefully to keep the mango pieces intact. Add onion and mix again. Taste for salt, and adjust if needed. This salsa is best consumed cold, within 2 days of preparation."
122,Tortillas de Harina (Flour Tortillas),"['3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more if needed', '¬Ω cup pork lard (or substitute vegetable shortening), chilled', '1 tablespoon kosher salt', 'About ¬Ω cup hot water', 'plus more if needed']","Mix the flour and pork lard with your fingers until the mixture is the texture of coarse sand. Then add the salt with the hot (but not scalding) water and knead well. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it‚Äôs a little dry, add more hot water. The kneaded dough should be slightly tacky but not sticking to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
 Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each one into a round ball. Roll each ball between sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap into as thin a round as possible (the rounds will contract a bit when you stop rolling). As you roll each one, place it on a hot nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
 Cook for about 30 seconds, or until the tortilla starts to puff. Then flip and cook another 30 seconds. It should be cooked through and just speckled with golden brown spots. As the tortillas cook, place them in your serving dish covered with a dish towel, which will help keep the tortillas soft and pliable."

Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.
 Pick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.
 Drain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then pur√©e, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.
 Add reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4‚Äì6 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.
 Do ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.
 Heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7‚Äì9 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.
 Wipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.
 To cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you‚Äôre good to go. (It‚Äôs important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it‚Äôs too hot, the batter will start to cook before it‚Äôs fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous ‚Öì-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8""-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle ‚Öõ tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.
 Serve dosas as they are ready with chutney alongside for dipping."

Reduce the heat to its lowest possible level, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add a touch more water if it looks like the mixture is drying out‚Äîit should still be a bit runny at the end.
 Meanwhile, place the chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups (500 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, remove from the heat, and soak in the liquid until ready to use. Drain the chickpeas, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of the liquid. Add the chickpeas to the awaze-flaxseed mixture, generously season with salt, and mix well.

 Press each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.
 Brush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6‚Äì8 minutes for small pieces and 8‚Äì10 minutes for large ones. Return to bowl (slide off of skewers if needed). Add Pecorino salsa verde and toss to combine. Spoon mushroom mixture over grilled bread."
154,Hickory-Smoked Baby Back Ribs,"['5 Tbsp (75 mL) packed brown sugar', '3 Tbsp (45 mL) kosher salt', '2 Tbsp (30 mL) sweet smoked paprika 4 tsp (20 mL) ancho chili powder', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) paprika', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) onion powder', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) freshly cracked black pepper 2 tsp (10 mL) dried thyme leaves', '6 racks baby back ribs, about 6 lb (2.7 kg)', '4 medium chunks hickory wood, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a charcoal grill) or 4 cups (1 L) hickory wood chips, soaked in water for at least 2 hours (if using a gas grill)', '3‚ÅÑ4 cup (185 mL) apple cider', '1‚ÅÑ2 cup (125 mL) ketchup', '3 Tbsp (45 mL) red wine vinegar', '1 Tbsp (15 mL) Dijon mustard', '2 tsp (10 mL) light soy sauce', '1 tsp (5 mL) Worcestershire sauce', '1 tsp (5 mL) molasses', '1‚ÅÑ2 tsp (2 mL) ancho chili powder', '1‚ÅÑ2 tsp (2 mL) ground cumin', '1‚ÅÑ2 tsp (2 mL) minced garlic', '1‚ÅÑ4 tsp (1 mL) freshly ground black pepper']","For the ribs, stir together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, chili powder, regular paprika, onion powder, black pepper and thyme. Set aside.
 With a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)
 Spread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.
 Fire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300¬∞F (120 to 150¬∞C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.
 Drain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.
 Place the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300¬∞F (120 and 150¬∞C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.
 Once the ribs are on, it‚Äôs time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don‚Äôt, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.
 The first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking. I like to tent my ribs before serving, so take them off the grill and let them rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10 minutes."

175,Roasted Strawberry Layer Cake,"['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2¬Ω tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400‚Äì450 g) fresh strawberries', '¬º cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', '¬Ω cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1‚Öì cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower', 'to decorate']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C). Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
 To make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it‚Äôs starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.
 To make the pur√©e, preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you‚Äôre ready to use it.
 To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn‚Äôt touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150¬∞F (65¬∞C). If you don‚Äôt have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.
 Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don‚Äôt panic‚Äîthis is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.
 Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don‚Äôt end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it‚Äôs fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry pur√©e on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.
 Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I‚Äôve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season)."

Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you‚Äôve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ¬Ω tablespoon until it appears just moistened‚Äîa dough that‚Äôs too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.
 Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.
 Using the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Soak the rice in water, generously covered, for at least 30 minutes. (This is optional but results in softer, more evenly cooked rice.) Drain thoroughly using a fine-mesh sieve.
 In a soup pot, dry-roast and stir the lentils continuously over medium heat until they are golden brown and have a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. (This step is optional but reduces the stickiness of the dal.) Thoroughly wash the lentils using a fine mesh colander. Return them to the pot, together with the rice, and add 3 1‚ÅÑ2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Skim the foam off the top. Add the turmeric powder, 2 tablespoons of the ghee, and the ginger to the boiling mixture.
 While the rice and lentils are cooking, put 1‚ÅÑ2 teaspoon of the ghee in a tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. Add the cashews, stirring them until they are fragrant and turn golden brown, a few minutes. Set the cashews aside to cool in a bowl lined with a paper towel. If using cumin seeds and peppercorns, roughly crush them in a mortar with a pestle. Set aside.
 When the rice and lentil mixture is cooked, mix in the salt, coconut, and fried cashews, reserving some cashews for garnish.
 Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee in the tempering pot or small pan over medium heat. When melted, add the crushed black peppercorns and cumin seeds and the asafetida. Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Turn off the heat.
 Immediately pour the spiced ghee over the rice. To get all of the spiced ghee out of the pot, put a spoonful of the rice mixture into the pot, stir, and spoon it back into the rest of the dish. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Garnish with the reserved cashews. Serve hot."

 In a food processor, combine the jalape√±os and the bell pepper and process, scraping down the sides as needed, until the peppers are very finely chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. (They will let off quite a bit of liquid; this is okay.)
 Transfer the contents of the food processor to a 4-quart stainless-steel or enameled Dutch oven. Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Boil, still stirring, for 3 minutes, then squeeze in the pectin. Return the mixture to a rolling boil, stirring continuously, and cook for 1 minute. Immediately remove from the heat and let rest until the foam has settled, about 1 minute. Skim off and discard any remaining foam.

 Drain the beans, put them in a pot, and add the dashi or water and soy sauce. Set over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring the beans on a regular basis. The level of liquid will reduce as the beans cook; once it gets to the point where it does not completely cover the beans, you will need to stir more often to ensure that the beans cook evenly. After an hour, the beans should be tender but still retain a little bite. If they are still hard, add more dashi or water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until the beans are tender with a little bite.
 Add the sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds to the pot and mix well. (It‚Äôs important to wait to add the sugar until the beans are tender, as adding it in the beginning will cause the beans to harden when refrigerated.) Let the beans cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (The beans will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.)

 Pat chicken dry again with paper towels (this will help the butter adhere and get the skin nicely browned). Smear garlic butter all over chicken. Gently lift the skin on the breast away from the flesh and rub some butter inside.
 Toss reserved green garlic and oil in a large cast-iron skillet or 13x9"" baking dish to coat; season with salt. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings underneath back. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of garlic in skillet.
 Roast chicken, rotating pan halfway through for even browning, until skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155¬∞F (don‚Äôt worry; temperature will climb to 165¬∞F as the chicken rests), 80‚Äì90 minutes. Let chicken rest at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes.
 Transfer chicken to a cutting board and carve as desired. Serve with roasted green garlic alongside."

 Meanwhile, whisk both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and 1¬º tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¬æ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.
 Scrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until butter is absorbed into sugar, about 30 seconds. Add egg, then egg yolks, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition; whisk in vanilla. Mixture should look much lighter in color and be almost creamy.
 Add dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Set aside a handful of chocolate, then add remaining chocolate to batter. Gently mix just to evenly distribute. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel (a silicone lid or plastic wrap also works) and chill 2 hours.
 Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375¬∞F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a tablespoon, scoop out 2-Tbsp. portions of dough (or, if you have one, this is a leveled-off #30 cookie scoop or a heaping #40) and place 5 on each baking sheet, spacing evenly. Roll into balls and gently press 2‚Äì3 pieces of reserved chocolate onto the top of each one. It‚Äôs okay to jam the chocolate on there‚Äîsome pieces can even be vertical.

(Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)
 Whisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.
 Pulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.
 Using a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.
 Roll out dough into a rough 8"" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4"" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4"" square. Roll dough back out to an 8"" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4"" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
 Place dates in a small bowl and pour in 1¬Ω cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.
 Drain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Pur√©e, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about ¬Ω cup pur√©e.)
 Grease a 10"" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8"" square. Fold in half into an 8x4"" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4"" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12"" square about ¬º"" thick. Dollop date pur√©e all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a ¬Ω"" border without pur√©e along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over pur√©e.
 Starting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about ¬Ω"" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1"" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.
 Cover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they‚Äôre doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1‚Äì1¬Ω hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.
 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350¬∞F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.
 Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.
 Brush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.

 Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly and using a rolling pin and your hands, press dough together to form a mass. Roll dough into a rough square about ¬Ω"" thick. Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about ¬Ω"" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6""-diameter disk.
 Dust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14""-diameter circle or oval about ‚Öõ"" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling.
 Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6"" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.

 Generously butter a 13x9"" baking pan (for thicker focaccia that‚Äôs perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13"" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)
 Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1¬Ω hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it‚Äôs ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn‚Äôt ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren‚Äôt, you can chill it up to 1 hour.)
 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450¬∞F. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you may not need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, as if you‚Äôre aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20‚Äì30 minutes.

 Make an assembly line with the shrimp, egg wash, coconut mixture, and prepared baking sheet. Dip the shrimp in the egg wash, then dredge in the coconut, lightly shaking off any excess, then place the coated shrimp on the baking rack. Repeat with the remaining shrimp, spacing them out evenly on the baking rack so they will get crispy instead of steaming.
 Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until the shrimp are cooked through and the coconut has started to brown.
 While the shrimp are cooking, make the salsa and sauce. In a medium bowl, toss together the salsa ingredients and set aside.
 In a food processor or high-powered blender, add the sauce ingredients and ‚Öì cup water. Pulse until smooth, adjusting the seasonings to your taste. If desired, spoon the sauce into a small zip-top bag and cut the tip off of one of the bottom corners (like you would to make a piping bag for icing), just enough to make a small hole. This will make it easier to drizzle your sauce more evenly, but you could also just use a spoon.

227,Orange Chocolate Loaf Cake From Florida,"['1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)', '1 cup sugar', '1 cup heavy cream', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '2 large eggs', 'Finely grated zest of 1 large, deep-colored orange', '1/3 cup orange juice', '3 tablespoons sugar']","Adjust rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. You will need a loaf pan measuring about 8¬Ω x 4¬Ω x 2¬æ inches, or one with about a 6‚Äëcup capacity. Butter the pan and dust it all over lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs, shake out excess crumbs, and set the pan aside.
 Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa, and sugar and set aside.
 Beat the cream and vanilla in the small bowl of an electric mixer until the cream holds a definite shape. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the egg is incorporated after each addition. (The eggs will thin the cream slightly.)
 Transfer to the large bowl of the mixer and gradually, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl and beating only until smooth. Remove from the mixer and stir in the grated zest. That‚Äôs all there is to it.
 Turn the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed with a fingertip.
 As soon as the cake goes into the oven, mix the orange juice with the sugar and let it stand while the cake is baking.
 After you remove the cake from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all.
 Let the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper. Invert the cake into the palm of your hand‚Äîeasy does it‚Äîremove the pan, cover the cake with a rack, and invert again, leaving the cake right side up."
228,Whipped Cream Cake,"['2 1/4 cups cake flour or 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted (measured by sifting into the cup and leveling it off)', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold', '3 large eggs, at room temperature', '1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract', '1 cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar', 'Special Equipment: 1 (10-cup) fluted metal tube pan', 'coated with baking spray with flour']","Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (350¬∞F if using a dark pan).
 In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt and then sift them together to make the mixture easier to incorporate.
 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk beater, whip the cream, starting on low speed, gradually raising the speed to medium-high as it thickens, until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised.
 In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla just until lightly combined.
 On medium-high speed, gradually beat the egg mixture into the whipped cream. The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.
 Detach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.
 Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.
 Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream."
229,Broccoli and Spam Stir-Fry,"['1 garlic clove, finely grated', '3 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil', '3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped mint or cilantro', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '1 large or 2 small heads of broccoli (about 1 lb.), ¬Ω"" trimmed from stem', '1 Tbsp. tamari or low-sodium soy sauce', '1 Tbsp. finely grated peeled ginger', '¬º tsp. crushed red pepper flakes', '¬º tsp. ground cinnamon', '2 Tbsp. vegetable oil', '2 shallots, thinly sliced crosswise, rings separated', 'Kosher salt', '1 (12-oz.) can Spam classic, sliced into ¬º""-thick planks, planks halved lengthwise', '1¬Ω cups cooked farro or brown rice']","Whisk garlic, oil, vinegar, and mint in a small bowl to combine; season with salt and pepper.

Use your hands to gently shape it into a round patty about 2 inches in diameter and coat it lightly on all sides with flour. Repeat with the remaining batter.
 Carefully transfer the patties to the pan and cook them slowly until the undersides are browned, about 3 minutes. Turn with a spatula and cook until the other sides are browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve immediately, with sour cream."
233,Charred Leeks With Honey and Vinegar,"['4 medium leeks (about 2¬Ω lb.), white and pale green parts only, tough outer layers removed (root ends left intact)', '2 Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar', '2 tsp. honey', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling', 'Kosher salt', 'freshly ground pepper']","Prepare a grill for high heat. Rinse off any sand and dirt from leeks and pat dry. Arrange directly on grate (no need to oil) and grill, turning every few minutes with tongs, until outsides are completely blackened (leeks should start to soften and may begin to release some juices), 12‚Äì16 minutes.
 Transfer leeks to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes (the interiors will continue to steam and get even softer as they cool).
 While the leeks are resting, whisk vinegar and honey in a small bowl until honey dissolves. Set dressing aside.
 Cut leeks on a diagonal into 1¬Ω""‚Äì2"" pieces. Transfer to a medium bowl and toss with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.
 Transfer leeks to a platter and spoon reserved dressing over. Drizzle with more oil and season with pepper."
234,Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot Cake,"['Vegetable oil (for pan)', '3 medium carrots, peeled', '1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1 cup (130 g) raw pistachios', '3 large eggs, room temperature', '1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar', '¬º cup (50 g) granulated sugar', '1¬æ tsp. baking powder', '¬º tsp. baking soda', '1¬Ω tsp. ground cardamom', '¬Ω tsp. ground cinnamon', '1¬º tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¬æ tsp. Morton kosher salt', '1¬Ω cups (188 g) all-purpose flour', '¬Ω cup carrot juice', '¬Ω cup heavy cream', '¬Ω cup (100 g) granulated sugar', '¬º tsp. kosher salt', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350¬∞F. Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9""-diameter cake pan with oil. Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles.
 Grate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2¬Ω cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!).
 Set a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what‚Äôs going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.
 Crack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking).
 Bake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50‚Äì55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper.
 Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
 Place a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it‚Äôs going to boil over, but it won‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail.
 Once the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it‚Äôs too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes.
 Stir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick. Let glaze cool at least 10 minutes before slicing cake."

Cut the jalape√±os in half and scrape the core (seeds and membranes) of two into a food-safe container. Dice the remaining jalape√±os and place into the food-safe container. Add the tequila and allow to infuse for 12 to 20 minutes, depending on spice level desired. Rebottle.
 Note: The recipe for the jalape√±o tequila will vary because not all jalape√±os are equally spicy. You need to taste it frequently to make sure it‚Äôs right. Ensure your tequila is not cold, as cold tequila will not infuse properly.
 Blend the watermelon in a blender to yield about 12 ounces of juice. Add the sugar and blend again until fully dissolved. Transfer to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
 Add all the ingredients, except for 1 mint leaf, the lime wheel, and salt, to a cocktail shaker with ice.

 Fold in remaining ¬Ω cup plus 2 Tbsp. (78 g total) flour. Then add eggs, milk, granulated sugar, baking soda, salt, and 3 Tbsp. melted butter and whisk, adding more milk if needed, until mixture is thick but pourable (you want it to be about the consistency of heavy cream). It will take awhile to work out lumps‚Äîa few small lumps are fine, but try to get batter as smooth as possible.
 Pour in enough oil to lightly coat a crepe pan or 10"" nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high (this is just to help get things going; you shouldn‚Äôt need to add more oil to the pan). Pour ¬º cup batter into center of pan and tilt and rotate pan as needed to coat bottom evenly with batter. Cook crepe, undisturbed, until surface looks dry and bottom is golden brown, about 45 seconds. Using tongs or an offset spatula, gently flip crepe and cook just until other side is golden, about 20 seconds. Transfer to a plate and slather a bit of room-temperature butter on top.

 Divide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10""-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes.
 Slap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you‚Äôre aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle. Tap against counter to smooth if needed, then tap ends to flatten. Repeat with second log. Return logs to baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes.
 Working one at a time, unwrap logs and brush sides with egg white. Working on baking sheet, sprinkle sides with remaining 1 cup sesame seeds and gently press to coat. Surface should be covered; use more sesame if needed. Freeze logs on baking sheet, uncovered, until surface is very firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour.
 Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Slice a log crosswise into ¬º""-thick triangles and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1"" apart. (If dough is soft or starts to lose its shape, freeze 10 minutes before continuing.) Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a platter or airtight container and line baking sheets with fresh sheets of parchment paper. Repeat process with remaining dough.
 Do Ahead: Dough can be rolled into logs 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Transfer to freezer 30 minutes before slicing. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature."

Add egg, 1 Tbsp. vanilla, and remaining 10 Tbsp. butter and process until a shaggy dough forms.
 Transfer dough to a large bowl and knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Using damp hands, pat dough evenly into skillet, extending all the way to the sides of the pan. Bake cookie until edges are golden brown and center is slightly puffed, 30‚Äì35 minutes. Let cool in skillet 1 hour. Invert cookie onto a cutting board and cut into 16 wedges. Turn right side up and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet.
 Whisk powdered sugar, milk, remaining ¬º tsp. salt, and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla in a small wide bowl until smooth. The glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; thin with more milk if needed. Transfer half of the glaze to another small wide bowl (you‚Äôll need to use 2 bowls as the glaze will start to collect crumbs and you‚Äôll want a fresh start).
 Working one at a time, lightly dip half of the wedges, top side down, into first bowl of glaze so that only the surface is covered and no glaze drips down the sides. Use a toothpick to pop any bubbles and smooth glaze; coating should be thin enough to see the cookie peeking through. Repeat with remaining wedges and second bowl of glaze.
 Top wedges with remaining candied pecans and let sit 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and glitter and let sit until glaze is set, about 1 hour.
 Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature."

Whisk in flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture smells slightly nutty, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk, then increase heat to medium-high, and still whisking constantly, bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook just until thick and no longer floury tasting, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Add Parmesan and whisk until melted, then whisk in cayenne and nutmeg; season with salt. Cover b√©chamel and keep warm until ready to use.
 Do Ahead: B√©chamel can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat over medium-low, whisking constantly and adding a splash of water if needed to loosen.
 Remove ribs and stems from Swiss chard leaves and thinly slice. Tear leaves into large pieces. Combine oil and sausage with Swiss chard ribs and stems in a large skillet and set over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up sausage with a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon into small pieces, until sausage is almost cooked through, 5‚Äì7 minutes.
 Add Swiss chard leaves to skillet a handful at a time, tossing and letting them wilt slightly between additions, until all the leaves have been added. Cook, reducing heat as needed (liquid should be bubbling slightly at this point), until liquid is almost completely evaporated (it‚Äôs important to dry out the Swiss chard here so the filling isn‚Äôt soggy), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in ricotta. Season filling with salt.
 If using pasta sheets, cook in a pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl of cold water. Lay out a row of pasta sheets on a rimmed baking sheet (don‚Äôt overlap), then top with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, placing sheets of paper between each layer.
 If using shells, cook in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, just until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package instructions; rinse under cold water to cool quickly.
 Preheat oven to 375¬∞F. Spread half of b√©chamel into a 13x9"" baking dish. If using pasta sheets, lay out a sheet on a clean surface with a short end facing you. Spoon a heaping ¬º-cupful of filling so it runs all the way down the center. Roll pasta around filling to create a 1 1/4""-diameter tube (the pasta will overlap quite a bit). Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, arranging in baking dish as you go to create 2 rows. If using shells, spoon a heaping tablespoonful of filling into each shell and nestle next to each other to create rows (you‚Äôll have about 5 rows of 6 shells each). Spread remaining b√©chamel over cannelloni, then marinara sauce. Top with Parmesan.
 Bake cannelloni until edges of pasta are lightly browned and sauce is bubbling around edges of pan, 30‚Äì40 minutes.

253,Cheesy Chicken Melt With All of the Onions Relish,"['4 teaspoons vegetable oil', '2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 1 pound (450g), sliced lengthwise into 4 flat 1‚ÅÑ2-inch-thick (1.3cm-thick) pieces', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '1‚ÅÑ2 yellow onion, sliced', '1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar', '1‚ÅÑ2 red onion, thinly sliced', '1‚ÅÑ2 bunch scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced', '2 tablespoons fried shallots (store-bought is totally great)', '3 tablespoons salted butter', '4 slices rye bread', '4 slices good melting cheese', 'such as Colby Jack or Muenster']","Heat a large saut√© pan with 2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil over high heat until it is smoking. Season the chicken with 3‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon of the salt and gently place it in the pan. Cook on one side until almost cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds, or until it is no longer pink. Transfer the chicken to a plate to rest.
 Immediately add the yellow onion and the remaining 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to the pan. Stir and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion is dark and smells amazing but is not burnt. If it‚Äôs getting too dark, lower the heat. Add the vinegar, along with the liquid that has collected on the plate where the chicken is resting, and turn the heat to low. Simmer the onion for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the onion to a bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape the pan out completely. When the onion has cooled down a little, about 5 minutes, add the red onion, scallions, fried shallots, and remaining 1‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine.
 Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same pan. Lay out two slices of bread on your work surface and place a slice of cheese on each. Top each piece of cheese with half of the onions, two pieces of chicken, and another slice of cheese, and cover with another slice of bread. Place the sandwiches in the pan with the melted butter. Cook over medium heat, about 3 minutes, until the cheese on the bottom slice is melted and the bread is nicely toasted. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and flip the sandwiches. Cook them for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the bottom is toasty. Remove the sandwiches from the pan, cut them in half, and insert a frilly toothpick or cocktail sword near the top in each half and serve."
254,Chicken Spiedies (Marinated Chicken on a Bun),"['1‚ÅÑ3 cup (80ml) vegetable oil', '1‚ÅÑ4 cup (60ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1‚ÅÑ4 cup (60ml) distilled white vinegar', '2 garlic cloves', '2 sprigs fresh mint', '2 sprigs fresh dill', '1‚ÅÑ2 tablespoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce', '1 teaspoon garlic powder', '1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1‚ÅÑ2 teaspoon dried oregano', '1‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon red pepper flakes', '1‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1 1‚ÅÑ2 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch (2.5cm) chunks', '4 super-soft hero rolls, split lengthwise', 'Shredded iceberg lettuce', 'chopped tomatoes', 'chopped white onion', 'sliced pepperoncini', 'and chopped olives']","In a blender, combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, mint, dill, salt, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes, and cardamom and puree until smooth and emulsified.
 Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it, reserving about 1‚ÅÑ2 cup marinade in a small bowl, and covering and refrigerating it. Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours. I, however, am a fan of that texture and think an aggressively long, 24-hour marinade gives the chicken that much more flavor.
 Heat a grill until it is so hot you (almost) can‚Äôt look directly at it. Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.
 To serve on the rolls, top with whichever of the following makes you the happiest: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, reserved marinade, pepperoncini, olives. Or don‚Äôt use any toppings, as it‚Äôs meant to be eaten, in my book (which this literally is)."

Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.
 In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Remove the pan from the heat and add ¬Ω cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Whisk the mixture until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is glossy and thickened a little. Pour the melted butter and sugar into the prepared cake pan and smooth into an even layer to cover the bottom. Place the cake pan in the freezer until the butter and sugar layer freezes; leave the pan in the freezer until you are ready to transfer the batter to the pan.
 In a small bowl, gently toss the lemon slices with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Leave the lemon slices in the sugar to macerate for 10 minutes.
 Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Set aside. Combine the eggs with the olive oil in another large bowl and beat vigorously with a whisk until well combined. Add the yogurt and sugar. Make a well in the flour mixture and add the wet mixture in three additions, folding in each addition until no dry bits of flour remain. Set aside.
 Fan the lemon slices out to cover the melted butter and sugar in the cake pan, overlapping the slices by as much as 1‚ÅÑ8 inch. Pour the cake batter directly on top of the lemon slices.
 Bake for about 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and carefully remove the parchment-paper lining. Allow the cake to cool for 1 hour more before serving.
 Note: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime. The rinds of grapefruit and oro blanco are much thicker than lemons and oranges and they will take longer to bake. Lime and grapefruit also retain too much of the bitter quinine flavor and will make for an odd-tasting cake"

Using a pastry cutter or fork, work butter into dry ingredients until shaggy crumbles form (you should have some large pieces, some small pieces, some flat pieces, and some sandy flour).
 Add sourdough starter and mix gently with fork to incorporate, then fold with your hands just until dough comes together with just a few crumbly pieces in the bottom of the bowl.
 Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and pat out with your hands until about ¬Ω‚Äù thick (the shape doesn‚Äôt matter too much at this point). Fold into thirds as you would a letter to create a rough rectangle. Working from short sides, fold in thirds like a letter again. Pat dough out to a ¬Ω‚Äù-thick square. Repeat folding process. Pat out dough for a third time to a 1‚Äù-thick square‚Äîit should feel airy, like a pillow at this point. Using a floured 2¬Ω‚Äù-diameter biscuit cutter or glass, punch out as many biscuits as you can (do not twist cutter). Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing at least 1‚Äù apart.
 Using your hands, gently press scraps into a rectangle, then fold in half. Pat out to a 1‚Äù-thick rectangle and cut out more biscuits.

 Place one block of the tofu on a cutting board. Cut it in half horizontally, then cut vertically down the center to yield four pieces. Repeat with the second block of tofu.
 Pour the marinade into a large baking dish, adding just enough water to ensure that it is runny, if necessary. Place the tofu in the marinade in one even layer. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, flipping the tofu every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. Remove the tofu from the marinade, scrape off any excess, and transfer to a large plate. Strain the marinade through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.
 In a large pot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Blanch the collard leaves, one at a time, for 30 seconds each, then lay them flat on clean kitchen towels to dry.
 Combine the arrowroot and the remaining 2 tea¬¨spoons salt in a pie plate. Mix well. Coat each side of the tofu pieces with the arrowroot, shake off any excess arrowroot, and transfer them to a second large plate.
 Lightly coat the bottom of a large cast-iron skillet with peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the tofu and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip each piece with a spatula and fry until golden brown on the second side. Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.
 On a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves. Smear 2 heaping tablespoons of the reserved marinade on top of the tofu, sprinkle a heaping teaspoon of garlic chips on top of the tofu, then fold the leaves around the tofu to create a packet. Repeat with the remaining collard leaves and tofu.
 In the same skillet, warm 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat, tilting the pan to coat it evenly with the oil. Place the packets in the skillet, folded-side up, and cook for about 1 minute. Gently flip each packet with a spatula, cover the skillet with a lid or some aluminum foil, and cook for about 5 minutes to warm through.
 To serve, spread some cilantro sauce over four plates and place two of the tofu packets on each plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and peanuts and serve."
319,Cassoulet Toast,"['2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling', '1 small onion, thinly sliced', '4 garlic cloves, peeled', '2 (15.5-ounce) cans butter beans, rinsed', '¬Ω cup canned chopped tomatoes', '2 sprigs thyme', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 cup plus tablespoon water', '1 prepared confit duck leg (5 ounces)', '4 thick slices airy country bread', 'Fresh Italian parsley leaves', 'chopped', 'for garnish']","Heat a medium (10-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, the onions, and 3 of the garlic cloves. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until the onions and garlic start to color. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes, or until caramelized.
 Add the beans, tomatoes, thyme, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, ¬º teaspoon salt, and 1 cup of the water. Turn the heat up to medium- high and bring to a simmer. Smash about one-eighth of the beans against the side of the pan with a fork to thicken the mixture. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.
 Transfer to a bowl, discard the thyme, and smash the garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper, stir well, and cover with foil to keep warm.
 Preheat the broiler.
 Rinse out the pan and return it to the stovetop. Add the confit duck leg skin-side down to the cold pan. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the remaining 1 tablespoon water, cover the pan, and cook for 10 minutes (when the skin softens, scrape it off the duck leg and continue cooking alongside it; this will become the crackling). Remove the lid, turn the duck leg, and continue cooking until the leg is warmed through and starting to crisp up, turning as needed.
 Continue cooking the duck skin (as if it were a slice of bacon) until nice and crisp, keeping in mind that it will crisp more as it cools (as if it were a slice of bacon), about 3 minutes longer. Drain on a paper towel.
 Toast the bread on both sides under the broiler until it is crisp on the outside and still soft inside. Rub each slice generously with the remaining garlic clove and top each slice with about ¬Ω cup of the beans. Shred the duck meat and divide it evenly among the toasts. Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with more oil, if desired, and crumble the crackling over the top. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve."

322,Crispy Tofu Balls,"['1 (19-ounce) package firm tofu', '‚Öì cup finely chopped scallions', '5 ‚Öì teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '4 tablespoons fresh corn, off the cob', '2 pinches ground white pepper', 'Spicy aioli, for garnish and dip', '1 cup all-purpose flour', '1 ¬º cups water', '2 ¬º teaspoons mushroom bouillon', '1 (12-ounce) package green glutinous rice flakes (aka com dep xanh)', '¬Ω cup cornstarch']","Pressing the tofu is the most important step, so I‚Äôm going to give y‚Äôall (I grew up in Texas, so I have the liberty to use ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù liberally) three pressing options. The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.
 Method 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance, California, at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time‚Äîthe boxes of tofu we use come four to a box‚Äîyou can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).
 Method 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates, and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.
 Method 3: (Most ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant, which is, without question, the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets, then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or, as we did successfully for four years, with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we‚Äôve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth.
 Lay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer, organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn‚Äôt hang over the sides of the sheets or it won‚Äôt be pressed evenly. Next, lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu, again, flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of ‚Äústuff‚Äù to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack, the tofu should flatten out only slightly, not be completely crushed.
 Processing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it, though like pressing, there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around), and do one of the following:
 Method 1: Use a food mill, which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it‚Äôs a great method for mashing anything).
 Method 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away, but you‚Äôll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn‚Äôt, um, well, mash.
 Method 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)
 Process the tofu until it is a consistent, almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3, make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won‚Äôt evenly distribute throughout the mix and, later, the balls.
 Add chopped scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and ground white pepper to the (hopefully) evenly processed tofu. Stick your hands in (maybe with gloves) and mix all the ingredients. Taste some of the mix from different areas of the bowl/container to make sure it‚Äôs evenly seasoned. It should taste savory, with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.
 Now it‚Äôs ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture, hand-pack it tightly into the spoon, then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist, packing it very tightly so it doesn‚Äôt fall apart.
 Continue by shaping into a ball, either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you‚Äôre playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands, moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion, like you would forming a meatball, only more gently to smooth out any cracks. Tofu is very docile; the more you do it, the better you‚Äôll get the feel of it (like most things in life). Place tofu balls on a plate or (ideally) a baking sheet rack.
 Optional: Refrigerate the balls overnight, uncovered. This will firm them up.
 Add flour, water, and mushroom bouillon to a bowl. Mix together. It should not be lumpy; the consistency should be not too thin and consistently thick enough to adhere, but not so thick it doesn‚Äôt drip off your finger.
 Empty the green rice flakes into a separate bowl or catering pan, then mix in half of the dry cornstarch with flakes. Next, drop balls into flour paste. Shake off excess paste (we highly recommend using a kitchen ‚Äúspider‚Äù strainer to do this), then roll balls around in the flakes until they‚Äôre fully coated. Gently clench the balls to pack one last bit of flakes onto the balls. If flakes start to drop off the balls, mix in more of the remaining cornstarch to dry flakes, then try again.
 Set balls on a rack.
 Optional: If you plan on making more and hate waste like we do, clean and dry your hands, then sift through all the flakes. Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball‚Äìrolling party!
 Optional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.
 Add at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 350¬∞F over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil‚Äôs too hot or you‚Äôre frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you‚Äôre frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.
 Remove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack. Plate and top with spicy aioli and more aioli on the side to dip."

Parmesan', 'finely grated']","Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 10 cups water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium to maintain a bare simmer.
 Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6‚Äì8 minutes. Add ¬Ω cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and tender, about 5 minutes. Taste onion; if it‚Äôs still firm at all, add a splash of water and continue to cook until meltingly soft.
 Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains are translucent around the edges and make a clattering sound when they hit against the pot, about 5 minutes. (Coating grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender.) Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes.
 Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in ¬æ-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and suspended in a fluid, not-too-thick creamy liquid, 25‚Äì30 minutes. It should take 2‚Äì3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging starches to release from risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but the finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking rice about 15 minutes after the first water addition; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn‚Äôt leave a chalky residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!
 Remove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid is creamy but very loose; stir in more hot salted water if needed. Taste and season with more salt.
 Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add mushrooms; cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften and release some liquid, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned and tender, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Add thyme, garlic, and butter and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar.

In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-low heat until a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, just until the eggs form fluffy curds but have not fully set; they should still be slightly runny. Remove from the heat and let cool in a medium bowl.
 Use your hands to gently fold the eggs, sesame oil, oyster sauce, remaining 1¬º teaspoons of salt, and pepper together until fully combined. Gently fold in the spinach and mix until fully incorporated.
 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.
 Fold the dumpling into the round yuan bao shape: Cradle the wrapper in your hands and fold the edge closest to you over the filling. Lightly squeeze the dumpling to push out any air bubbles. Clasp one end of the dumpling between your thumb and index finger to pinch it shut; repeat on the other side of the dumpling. Cradle the dumpling in your palms, clasping the sealed edge between your thumbs and index fingers, and squeeze it shut while pushing inward, making sure to squeeze out any air bubbles. The dumpling's belly should form a teardrop shape between your thumbs, which will create the yuan bao shape. Inspect the dumpling for any fissures that could rupture during cooking and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers.
 Working in batches, add the dumplings to the pot, 6 at a time. Boil for 2 minutes on high, then reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 1 minute, then reduce the heat again to medium and cook for 2 more minutes.

Wrap the zucchini in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel and squeeze to wring out excess moisture.
 In a medium bowl, add the lamb and slowly pour in the peppercorn-infused water, a few drops at a time, and use your hands to mix it in well until the water is fully absorbed. Add the scallions, wine, ginger, soy sauce, and salt, and mix well until fully incorporated. Gently fold in the zucchini and mix until well combined.
 Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.

Serve immediately, then clean the skillet and repeat with the remaining dumplings."
379,Boiled or Panfried Dumpling Dough,"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1‚ÅÑ8 teaspoon kosher salt', '¬æ cup lukewarm water', '1 egg white']","Mix the Dough: Add the flour to a wide mixing bowl and stir in the salt. Stir in the water and egg white with your fingers. The flour will look shaggy, like biscuit dough; as the dough comes together, run an open palm around the edge of the bowl and fold the flour into the center, spinning the bowl with your other hand as you go, until it all forms a rough clump. It‚Äôs fine if there are still pockets of dry flour.
 Knead the Dough: Coat your work surface with a fine dusting of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl. Dust your hands with flour and shape the dough into a fat log about the width of your hand. Knead the dough by pushing your hands and wrists into the log and rolling it forward. Then roll it back and push again. Repeat a few times until the log moves easily, adding more flour if it sticks, then spin the log 90 degrees, shape it into a horizontal log again, and knead a few more times, adding more flour if necessary. Use no more flour than you need to keep the dough from drying out. As you knead, the dough will get firmer and tougher with a texture reminiscent of a gummy bear. It‚Äôs ready when it‚Äôs smooth to the touch, like the surface of a pearl, not tacky, with no cracks or pockets of dry flour. There may be some lumps. Put the dough back in your work bowl and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let it sleep for 15 to 30 minutes. While it relaxes, you can prepare your filling.Knead Again: Dust your work surface with a little more flour, then knead it as before. Work out all those lumps; after kneading about ten times you should have satin-smooth dough that forms a clean ball you can easily push into, like the gel of a shoe insert.Portion the Dough: Form your dough into a log, dust a dough scraper with a little flour, and cut the dough into four equal sections. Roll each section into a log and chop it into six pieces for a total of twenty-four balls of dough, each about an inch in diameter. Toss the balls with a light coating of flour and cover with a lightly moistened towel.Roll the Dough Into Wrappers: Gently smash the balls of dough into flat disks, then lightly roll an Asian-style rolling pin across them to flatten them out a bit more. Hold one disk by its edge and firmly but gently roll your pin from the disk‚Äôs edge to its center. Roll the same edge a few more times, using more pressure at the edge than at the center. Use your other hand to turn the dough disk and reveal a new edge of the disk; roll again. Continue until all edges are rolled out and the wrapper is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Hold your rolled-out wrapper up to a light. If you can see through it faintly, your wrapper is ready to go. Otherwise, keep rolling. Roll the edges to half the thickness of the center of the wrappers. As you get faster, you‚Äôll notice that all your active hand needs to do is roll the pin back and forth while your other hand just rotates the wrapper. As long as your hands stay in these fixed motions, you‚Äôll easily make even, round wrappers though they don‚Äôt need to be perfectly uniform. Place freshly rolled wrappers under a lightly moistened towel to keep them from drying out."

Stir in the beans, salt, and pepper and cook until the beans absorb some of the seasoning and are hot all the way through, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.
 Using a potato masher or an immersion blender, mash the beans in the pot to make a paste. Mash in the cilantro and dill and let cool to room temperature.
 Cut the lavash into 12 strips 3 in [7.5 cm] thick and about 12 in [30.5 cm] long. Keep cut lavash covered or in a plastic bag so the strips don‚Äôt dry out.
 To shape each triangle, position a strip of lavash in front of you vertically. Place about 2 Tbsp of bean paste at the bottom end of the strip. Pull the bottom left corner of the strip to the right side, about 3 in [7.5 cm] up from the bottom, to create a triangle that encases the beans. Next, take the bottom right corner of the triangle and fold it away from you to the left edge of the lavash to enclose the filling, ‚Äúrolling‚Äù the triangle up the lavash and adding a layer to the triangle. Continue to fold the triangle all the way up the strip until all of the lavash is used up. If any extra lavash hangs off the edge, trim it with scissors. Once finished, place the triangle seam-side down and repeat with the remaining strips and filling.
 Line a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Place half of the triangles seam-side down in the oil and fry until golden brown on one side, about 1 minute, adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the lavash from burning. Flip the triangles over to brown the other side, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Transfer to the paper towel‚Äìlined plate and repeat with the remaining oil and triangles. If the pan seems too dry after flipping over the triangles, add more oil. Let cool slightly before serving.

 Rinse chicken under water, pat dry with paper towels, then transfer to a mixing bowl. Next, pour the beautiful curry spice mix all over that chicken. Mix and rub the spices all over the chicken until no chicken remains uncovered with spice. Cover it all up, like it‚Äôs your only goal in life.
 Marinate overnight. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre in a hurry, marinate for 1 hour, though the curry mix won‚Äôt fully penetrate the chicken or touch the souls of others, which is what eating is all about.
 When ready to cook, you‚Äôll need a pan to saut√© with and a pot for stewing and braising.
 Combine coconut milk, whole milk, and sambal badjak in pot.
 Next, heat the saut√© pan to medium-high heat. Add a little bit of cooking oil, add some onions and some lime leaves, and sear batches of chicken until chicken turns golden brown all around, while sweating onions and leaves. Do not cook the chicken through; just brown and sear. The lime leaves will fill your kitchen with their incredible citrus scent‚Äîa pretty amazing smell.
 After each batch is evenly seared, transfer into pot. To ensure the chicken cooks evenly, do not heat up the pot until all chicken is seared. Continue searing onions, lime leaves, and chicken. Once all chicken is seared, saut√© any remaining lime leaves, and onions, and transfer to the pot before cooking. If there is any excess spice mix in the chicken marinade bowl, also transfer into the pot because the spice mix is measured specifically to give the best flavor for the curry sauce itself and not just the marinade.
 Bring pot to a boil over high heat, then simmer covered with a slight opening for 35‚Äì45 minutes, or until the chicken is tender but not falling apart. The curry consistency should be thin and almost milky. Once chicken is done, turn off heat.
 While waiting for the chicken to finish cooking, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl. Bring 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in a pot over high heat. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water for 6‚Äì8 minutes. Check often to see when the potatoes are cooked through; they should be crunchy, still firm and not mushy. Once they‚Äôre done, remove the potatoes from pot (but do not dump the boiling water; save it for blanching the carrots) and shock them immediately in the ice water bath for 2 minutes, or until they are completely cool to the touch. Strain and set aside cooked potatoes in a fresh bowl.
 Next, blanch the carrots by repeating the steps as for the potatoes, checking for nonmushy doneness. If you use baby carrots, they take about 4‚Äì5 minutes to blanch. Adjust time accordingly for the type of carrots you‚Äôre using and how they‚Äôre cut. Cook, shock, strain, then set aside with the potatoes.
 Chicken can be served immediately, but it will be most flavorful if cooled down, stored, and covered overnight in the fridge, and then reheated and served the next day. Blanched potatoes and carrots can also be stored overnight.
 When ready to serve (not long before‚Äîjust right when you are ready to serve), add carrots and potatoes to the hot chicken curry. Garnish with scallions. Serve with steamed rice, and if you want to soak up that curry deliciousness (my favorite part), sop it up with some Buttermilk Beer Beignets.
 And that‚Äôs the best experience with chicken curry that you can have‚Äîreaching the epitome of chicken curry enlightenment. Enjoy, kids!"

 Bring a small pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Use a knife to separate the leaves from the chard stems so you have 2 leaves from each stem. Thinly slice the stems crosswise. Dip the chard leaves in the boiling water for 10 seconds to soften; drain, cool slightly, and pat dry. Cut the fish into 8 equal-sized pieces, season with salt and pepper, and spread 2 teaspoons of the olive mixture on each piece of fish.
 Place 1 piece of fish on a piece of chard and roll it up; use the extra 2 leaves to patch any parts that need extra wrapping.

Peel off the skins.
 In a small saucepan, combine the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and oil. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is evenly golden brown on all sides, about 12 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and transfer the rest of the mixture to a blender (or use an immersion blender). Add the fish sauce and pepper. Blend until the mixture is smooth.
 DO AHEAD: Keep in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, or 2 months in the freezer. Thaw and/or stir before use.
 Even though some of the spices are already ground, we will process them a second time to get a finer powder that will stick well to the chickpeas. In a spice grinder, grind the spice mix ingredients to a fine powder. Set aside.
 In a deep frying pan or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches (5 cm). Heat over medium-high until the oil bubbles up immediately around an inserted wooden chopstick.
 Meanwhile in a large bowl, toss the chickpeas with the buttermilk and the 1 tablespoon of flour until they are evenly coated in this light batter. In a separate large bowl, mix the remaining cup (31 g) flour, the garlic powder, baking soda, white pepper, and salt. Add the coated chickpeas to the flour mixture and toss until you have a slightly wet but crumbly mixture. It may look like the chickpeas are kind of sticking together, but it‚Äôs okay.
 In a large bowl, mix the garlic with 2 teaspoons of the Garlic Confit Sauce (save the rest for another day). Set aside.
 Now, in several small batches as needed, add the breaded chickpeas to the hot oil and start breaking them apart with a chopstick. It‚Äôs okay if they are in small clumps of 2 to 4 chickpeas. Fry for a couple of minutes, until the chickpeas are golden brown all around. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the garlic sauce and repeat to fry the rest of the chickpeas.
 Add the basil leaves to the frying oil and immediately cover the pot with a lid, leaving a small slit for the steam to escape. When the popping sound has subsided, remove the lid and fry the basil until crispy. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the chickpeas.
 Toss the chickpeas to coat them evenly with the garlic mixture, then add the spice mixture and toss until evenly coated. Season with more salt if needed. Serve immediately."

Combine the pod, seeds, and milk in a medium saucepan and set it over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding. When it is almost at a simmer, turn off the heat. Place a sieve over the saucepan so that it dips into the milk but doesn‚Äôt sink to the bottom, then add the chamomile tea. Let steep for 5 minutes.
 In a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer or whisk, whisk the egg yolks, honey, and sugar until thick and velvety, about 2 minutes (you should see ribbons fall from the whisk). Add the flour and custard powder, then whisk until lump-free. Remove the chamomile and vanilla pods from the milk, then slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 mL) of the hot milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Add the yolk mixture back to the pan, then set it over medium-low heat. Whisking constantly, let the mixture bubble gently until you have a thick custard (take the pot off the heat and whisk to blend if lumps start forming on the side of the pan). Turn off the heat and whisk in the unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time, until evenly incorporated. Let cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. The custard can be made a couple of days ahead.
 With a serrated knife, remove the crust from the bread on all sides, then cut the loaf into two 5-inch (13-cm) cubes. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.
 In a large bowl, whisk the milk, egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, scatter a thin layer of granulated sugar. Working one at a time, dip the bread cubes in the milk mixture for just a couple of seconds on each side, then place them on a baking sheet. With a spoon, scatter a generous but even layer of granulated sugar over each side (you need a good coating to get that hardened caramel shell).
 Set a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add enough butter to thinly coat the surface. Use a flat spatula to gently place the coated bread cubes in the skillet, then fry on each side until the sugar is golden brown and caramelized. If you see burned sugar in the skillet as you cook, remove it with a spoon. Keep adding more butter as needed.
 Let the cubes cool slightly on a cooling rack (the caramel needs a couple of minutes to harden). They can be made 15 minutes before serving but no longer. Right before serving, cut out a 2-inch (5-cm) hole on one side of each cube, then remove about half of the bread from the interior (chopsticks are perfect for this job). Using a piping bag or plastic bag with a cutout hole, squeeze the chilled custard inside to fill the cavity up to the top. Sprinkle with tart berries (I used blueberries because that was what I had, but more sour berries like raspberries or strawberries would work better) and a bit of powdered sugar. Dig in."

449,Portobello Mushroom Wellington,"['8 large portobello mushrooms', '2 garlic cloves, diced', '1 teaspoon thyme leaves', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '100g (3 ¬Ω ounces) spinach', '1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, grated', '1 tablespoon Marsala', '3 egg yolks, beaten', '320g (about 11 oz.) ready-rolled puff pastry sheet', '1 teaspoon black onion seeds', '100g (1/2 cup) butter', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '4 white onions, sliced', '1 teaspoon thyme leaves', '2 garlic cloves, sliced', '1 tablespoon Marsala', '3 eggs', '100g (about ¬æ cup) all-purpose flour', '300ml (1 ¬º cups) whole milk', '1 teaspoon chopped rosemary', 'Sunflower oil, for frying', '2 tablespoons olive oil', '2 shallots, diced', '2 garlic cloves, diced', '1 teaspoon chopped thyme leaves', '50ml (about 1/4 cup) dry sherry (Manzanilla or Fino)', '200ml (about 3/4 cup) vegetable stock', '250ml (1 cup) heavy cream', 'Steamed broccolini and kale']","Wipe the mushrooms with a piece of damp paper towel to remove dirt and grit; twist out and discard the stalks. Place in a large roasting tray with the garlic, thyme, Marsala, oil and salt and pepper. Rub each mushroom with the garlicky oil and cover the tray with tin foil. Place in an oven heated to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) for 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have reduced in size and are soft throughout. Remove the foil, drain away the cooking liquid and set the tray on a cool surface while you prepare the rest of the Wellington.
 For the onions, melt the butter with the oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. When all the butter has melted, add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions turn soft and translucent. Add the thyme, garlic and Marsala to the pan and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until the onions are golden and caramelized all over. Remove the onions from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels to drain away the excess oil and butter. Leave to cool completely.
 Next, make the pancakes. Whisk the eggs with the flour in a large mixing bowl, then slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time until no lumps are visible. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface of the batter.
 Warm a 26 cm. (10 in.) non-stick frying pan with a splash of sunflower oil over a medium-high heat. Pour half a ladle of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to evenly coat the base.
 Cook each pancake for a minute on each side, until lightly golden, then flip and cook the other side. The mixture should produce 6-8 thin pancakes.
 Cook the spinach for a minute with a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg in a frying pan until bright green and just wilted. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can through a sieve, then dry on kitchen paper.
 Lay out a 30cm (12 in.) piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface, then lay 4 cooled pancakes alongside each other on the plastic wrap (you can use any extra when making the Wellington), ensuring a generous amount of overlap so that there is a continuous length down the middle of the plastic wrap. Brush the pancake all over with some of the egg yolk, then arrange the spinach down the middle of the pancakes, leaving a couple of centimeters at each end without spinach.
 Place the mushrooms on top of the spinach, placing one on top of the other, giving four layers of two down the center. Top the mushrooms with the caramelized onion mixture, then use the plastic wrap to lift the pancake over the filling on either side. Fold over the ends and continue rolling until you have a tight cylinder shape. If there are any gaps, use the extra pancakes to patch up, brushing with egg yolk as you go. Wrap the pancake tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.
 Roll out the sheet of puff pastry and brush with egg yolk. Remove the chilled pancake cylinder from the fridge and unwrap the cling film. Place in the middle of the puff pastry sheet and fold the pastry over the filled pancake to encase it completely. Crimp the sides of the pastry and brush with egg yolk all over. Scatter over the black onion seeds and cook in an oven heated to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) for 25-30 minutes, until dark golden all over.
 While the Wellington is cooking, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat, then add the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the thyme and dry sherry and bring to the boil. Reduce for 3 minutes, then add the stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, then add the heavy cream and turn the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.
 Serve the Wellington with the tarragon cream sauce in a jug for pouring over and steamed broccolini and kale on the side."

452,Super-Simple Overnight Porridge,"['2 cups packed cooked white rice', 'About 5 cups chicken stock, vegetable stock, or store-bought chicken or vegetable broth', '2 cups water, plus more as needed', '3 thick slices unpeeled ginger, bruised', '2 green onions, white parts kept whole, green parts cut into thin rings', 'About ¬Ω teaspoon fine sea salt', 'Recently ground black pepper (optional)']","In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the rice, chicken stock, and water. Cover and let sit overnight at cool room temperature (around or below 60¬∞F) or in the refrigerator.
 The next morning, add the ginger and the white parts of the green onions to the pot. Partially cover (a small gap is perfect to minimize evaporation and avoid a boil over) and bring to vigorous simmer over high heat. Lower the heat and gently simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed. When done, most of the liquid will have been absorbed (you‚Äôll see little separation between the rice and liquid). Discard the ginger and green onions. Stir the pot, cover tightly, turn off the heat, and let rest for 10 minutes to finish thickening. The desired thickness of the porridge can vary according to taste; it can be rustic and thick, or elegant and thin, or somewhere in between. If needed, add a splash of water to thin or cook a little longer to thicken. Taste and season with the salt.
 When ready to serve, reheat the porridge to a simmer, then ladle into individual bowls. Garnish with sliced green onions and pepper.
 Lean, light-tasting ch√°o responds well to fatty, salty, spicy, herbal enhancements. In addition to (or instead of) garnishing your porridge with green onion and pepper, consider the following, and feel free to mix and match.
 Crisp chopped bacon, a fried or soft-boiled egg, and maybe chopped kimchi for punch.
 Lemongrass Tempeh Crumbles or Crispy Caramelized Pork Crumbles.
 Chopped Sriracha Tofu, fried onions or shallots, and coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, mint, or basil.
 Crack a raw egg into the bowl before ladling in the hot soup. Top with crumbled rice crackers and perhaps ribbons of Korean toasted seaweed snacks (one pack of gim is enough for a batch). Stir well before eating.

457,Lavash,"['¬Ω cup [70 g] all-purpose flour', '¬º cup plus a scant 1 Tbsp [70 ml] lukewarm water', '¬º tsp instant yeast', '1 cup [240 ml] lukewarm water', '1 Tbsp sunflower oil or other neutral oil', '2 tsp kosher salt', '3 cups plus 2 Tbsp [440 g] all-purpose flour', 'plus more for dusting']","To make the old dough, using your hands or a rubber spatula, squish together the flour, water, and yeast in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Scrape the paste into a small, lightly oiled container, cover, and let it sit out for 1¬Ω to 2 hours, or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using. When ready, the ball will have doubled in volume.
 In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt. Squish the old dough with your hands to break it up in the water; it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfectly mixed in.
 Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and add a third of the flour. Mix on low speed until the dough looks like pancake batter. Add the remaining flour and mix on low speed until incorporated. Remove the paddle attachment, pulling off any dough stuck to it. If there is flour at the base of the bowl, use your hands to press the dough into the flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough sit for 20 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.
 Remove the towel and attach the dough hook to the stand mixer. Mix the dough on medium speed until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl without sticking and feels smooth to the touch, about 4 minutes. Turn the mixer off and reposition the dough to the center of the bowl if it seems to get stuck on one side of the bowl.
 Combine the old dough, water, oil, and salt in a large bowl and mix together, squishing the old dough into the water with your hands. Stir in the flour gradually with your fingers until a crumbly dough forms, then knead it a few times in the bowl by folding the dough over itself and pressing it down into the bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
 Dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Begin kneading by stretching and folding the dough over itself until it is smooth to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes.
 Lightly oil an 8 cup [2 L] glass Pyrex or a large glass bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a lid, a plate, or plastic wrap, and let it rest for 3 hours or until doubled in volume. Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning.
 To portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.
 To shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1¬Ω hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out.
 Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn‚Äôt have to look perfect.
 Place a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.
 Heat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
 Drape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.
 Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.
 Place a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
 Drape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.
 Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn‚Äôt get too hot.
 Have tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.
 Heat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.
 Transfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.
 Eat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It‚Äôs okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it‚Äôs still cracking, mist with more water."

Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided', '1¬Ω cups whole pecans', '1 Tbsp. pure maple syrup', 'Whipped cream (for serving; optional)']","Whisk rye flour, sugar, salt, and 1¬Ω cups all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pieces of butter that are flat and thin and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water over, running your fingers through flour mixture to evenly distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add more ice water by the teaspoonful if needed, just until dough comes together).
 Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to incorporate shaggy edges and any loose bits. Dust surface and dough lightly with flour to keep dough from sticking. Using your hands, form dough into about a 7x5"" rectangle. Using your rolling pin, gently tap and press dough to compact and tidy up edges. Roll out dough, dusting dough and surface as needed, until 3 times longer than when you started. Fold dough over onto itself in thirds like a letter to make a square. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.
 Preheat oven to 400¬∞F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 12"" round. Wrap dough around your rolling pin and unfurl into a standard 9""-diameter pie dish. Gently lift dough so it slumps down into edges of dish. Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350¬∞ and bake crust until edges are golden, 20‚Äì25 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5‚Äì10 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping.
 Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 3 days ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
 While your crust is baking, combine eggs, egg yolk, pie filling, cream, granulated sugar, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, 6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, and ¬Ω tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¬º tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl and blend with an immersion blender until smooth; try not to aerate. (Alternatively, you can whisk mixture well and blend in 2 batches in a blender until smooth and homogenous.)
 Pour into crust and bake pie (still at 350¬∞F) until filling is puffed and mostly set with just a slight wobble in the center when gently shaken, 40‚Äì45 minutes.
 Just before the pie is done baking, toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8‚Äì10 minutes.
 Whisk reserved egg white, remaining 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and remaining ¬æ tsp. salt in a small bowl until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add syrup and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter; whisk just to combine. Add pecans and toss to coat.
 Carefully remove pie from oven and top with pecan mixture, allowing any excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl. Return pie to oven and bake until filling is completely set (a tester or paring knife inserted into the center should come out clean) and nuts are not tacky to the touch, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool, at least 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
 Do Ahead: Pie can be baked 1 day ahead. Store uncovered in a cool oven or at room temperature."

 Turn dough out onto a surface and work together with your hands, pushing and flattening until dough holds together when squeezed in your palm but some streaks of dry flour are still visible. Divide dough into 2 portions.
 Flatten 1 portion of dough into an 8""-diameter disk. Cut into quarters, stack pieces on top of one another, and flatten dough with a rolling pin to about half of its original height. At this point dough should hold together with no dry spots remaining, and have nice big flakes of butter showing. Use a bench scraper or a large knife to clean any clingy bits of dough from surface. Dust surface with flour, then dust top of dough with flour. Roll out to a ¬º""‚Äì‚Öú""-thick round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9""-diameter pie dish. Unfurl into dish, then lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim overhang to an even 1"" (there will be some excess). Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Cover and chill until very cold, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours (cover tightly if chilling longer than 1 hour). Repeat process with remaining dough and another pie dish. Or form into a 1¬Ω""-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill up to 3 days (or freeze up to 1 month).
 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 400¬∞F. Lay 2 sheets of parchment paper over dough and fill with pie weights or dried beans (they should fill the dish).

 Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350¬∞F and spread the wheat germ onto a half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pan. Toast until slightly aromatic, approximately 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
 In a bowl, whisk together the flours, salts, and toasted wheat germ. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar and mix on low speed until the dough starts to resemble a coarse meal, 6 to 8 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough just starts to clump around the paddle or to the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.
 Place the dough on a surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll the dough back and forth into a cylinder. Using your fingers, pat the dough into a rectangle. Put a sheet of parchment paper the same dimensions as a half sheet pan on the work surface and dust lightly with flour. Put the dough on top.
 Using a rolling pin, begin rolling out the dough. If any cracks form in the dough, stop to push them together. To keep the dough from sticking to the parchment paper, dust the top lightly with flour, cover with another piece of parchment paper, and, sandwiching the dough between both sheets of parchment paper, flip the dough and paper over. Peel off the top layer of parchment paper and continue to roll. Roll the dough into a 10 by 12- or 14-inch rectangle approximately ¬º inch thick. If the surface is uneven, roll a pastry roller across the surface to even it out.
 Ease the dough and parchment paper onto a half sheet pan. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and refrigerate until firm, at least 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 350¬∞F. Line a couple of half sheet pans with parchment paper.

545,Caramel Apple Cupcakes,"['2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour', '3 tsp. baking powder', '1 tsp. ground cinnamon', '1/2 tsp. salt', '16 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended)', '2 cups sugar', '4 large eggs, at room temperature', '1/3 cup hot water', '2 1/2 cups freshly grated apples (4 to 5 medium-size apples‚Äîwe use Gala apples, but you can use your favorite type)', '4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended)', '4 cups confectioners‚Äô sugar, sifted', '1/4 tsp. pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey pure Madagascar Bourbon recommended)', '6 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature', '2 cups sugar', '1 Tbsp. water', '12 tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended)', '1 tsp. pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey pure Madagascar Bourbon recommended)', '1 cup heavy cream', 'at room temperature']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Line a standard cupcake pan with twelve paper baking cups, and a second pan with six baking cups, or grease pans with butter if not using baking cups.
 Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and set aside.
 Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until fluffy. Stop to add the sugar; beat on medium speed until well incorporated, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
 Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly on medium speed, after each addition. It‚Äôs important to add them one at a time so that they will completely incorporate into the batter and you don‚Äôt put too much weight on your batter at once. This would collapse all the little air bubbles you created when you creamed the butter and sugar.
 Reduce the speed to low. At this stage, it‚Äôs always important to mix as slowly and as little as necessary since you don‚Äôt want to traumatize your batter. Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. It‚Äôs important to add the flour and water little by little like this, so that your batter does not have too much weight thrown on it and that you allow each amount of flour and water to completely mix into the batter. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and beat just until combined.
 Using a spatula, fold the grated apple into the batter. Take care not to overmix the batter. If you overmix the batter, the cupcakes will not be light and fluffy but instead very dense.
 Use a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the cups are two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. After 5 minutes, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely for approximately 20 minutes. It‚Äôs always best to cool the cupcakes at room temperature. Putting them in the refrigerator to cool can dry out the cake.
 Place all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed at the very end for at least 2 minutes to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy.
 Pour the sugar and water into a large saucepan. Heat on medium-high heat and stir constantly until the sugar completely liquefies. Stir constantly and be careful not to burn the sugar. After all the sugar has dissolved, add the butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and mix thoroughly. Once the butter has melted and the butter and sugar are completely mixed, remove from heat and, using a whisk, slowly whisk in the heavy cream until you reach a beautiful golden brown caramel color. Set aside and let cool and thicken for 5 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to thicken further before you use to fill or decorate."
546,Roasted and Marinated Root Vegetables,"['2 pounds beets, sweet potatoes, or turnips (any color, golf ball‚Äìto baseball-size)', '1/4 cup rice bran oil, grapeseed oil, or olive oil', '1 tablespoon kosher salt', '2 teaspoons sugar or honey', '1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '2 sprigs thyme', '2 sprigs rosemary', 'Juice of 1 orange or lemon, or 2 tablespoons red, champagne, or cider vinegar', '2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', '1/2 teaspoon crushed red chile flakes']","Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.
 Depending on the size and type of the root, peel it or not. Peel the dirty, gnarly beets. Sweet potato skins soften up when roasting, so leave those on. For thinner-skinned turnips, a good scrubbing will do.
 Cut the roots into chunks; I like them about 1 inch thick and 2 inches long. Cut the round roots through the equator and chunk them up from there. For sweet potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, then again lengthwise, and then into 2-inch pieces. If you can find baby sweet potatoes, just cut those in half. There‚Äôs no wrong way to do this; just keep all of your vegetables similar in size and shape so they cook evenly.
 Preheat an ovenproof saut√© pan large enough to hold the root vegetables in one layer over medium-high heat. Add the rice bran, grapeseed, or olive oil and continue heating until the oil shimmers and is thinking about smoking. Carefully add the roots and let them caramelize on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Check to make sure they‚Äôre not burning‚Äîlower the heat if they‚Äôre scorching in some spots. Give the roots a toss in the pan (tongs work, too) and season with the salt, sugar, and pepper. Add the thyme and rosemary and transfer the pan to the oven.
 Cook until the vegetables are lightly browned and tender. Start checking with the tip of a sharp knife after 6 minutes and continue to check every 5 minutes. They‚Äôre done when they‚Äôre easily pierced all the way through. The beets will cook in about 30 minutes, the turnips in just 10 minutes or less, and the sweet potatoes in 20 minutes. This will depend on the age, variety, and cut of the vegetable, so use your senses (including common sense) and check often.
 Spoon the roasted vegetables into a large bowl. Discard the herb stems. Add the orange juice or vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, and chile flakes. Toss until well coated.
 You can serve at this point, or store in the fridge for up to 5 days."

Add the kale and toss to combine‚Äîreally get in there and work the kale with your hands; this isn‚Äôt a gentle massage. Set the kale aside to marinate at room temperature for 2 hours or in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, you could toss the kale in with the just-roasted, marinating beets along with the cheese, olive oil, et al., and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 2 hours or in the fridge overnight. They‚Äôll marinate just the same.
 Combine the hazelnuts, hazelnut oil, vinegar, shallot, thyme, honey, salt, and pepper in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake it until the dressing comes together. Set aside until ready to serve or store in the fridge for up to 5 days.
 Preheat a large cast-iron pan over high heat for 5 minutes. When the pan looks very hot (you see little wisps of smoke), add the marinated beets and char on one side for 1 minute, just long enough to get some char. Remove the beets from the pan and add the kale, again charring for 1 minute. You are looking to just heat the kale, not fully cook it. You also could do this over the high heat of a grill. Remove the pan from the heat.
 Spread the cheese over a large platter. Season it a bit with salt and pepper. Scatter the charred kale and beets over the cheese, douse with the hazelnut vinaigrette, and finish with the chopped hazelnuts"

Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using 1/2-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed.
 Use bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over. Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile. Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8"" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don‚Äôt panic. Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90¬∞ and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed. Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding. Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1"" thick. Chill 30 minutes.
 Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12""‚Äì14"" round or oval about 1/8"" thick (don‚Äôt worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.
 Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out."

This will keep, covered, in the fridge for a few days.
 Using tweezers, carefully remove any pin bones from the salmon fillet. Find a deep baking dish or plastic container that holds the fish snugly.
 Combine the sugar, salt, and shiso in a bowl. Sprinkle a 1/2-inch layer of the mixture in the baking dish and lay the salmon on top, skin side down. Pack the fish in the rest of the salt-sugar-shiso mixture and cover loosely with a large piece of plastic wrap. You need to weight down the salmon, which you can go about in a couple different ways: A) If you have a dish or container that is slightly smaller than the one the salmon is sitting in, set the smaller container on top of the fish and weight it down with a few cans or a brick; B) Alternatively, fill a large zip-top bag three-quarters full with cold water and seal. Nestle the bag over the piece of fish. If the bag hangs over the sides of the baking dish, pour out some of the water and reseal. In either case, wrap the whole apparatus tightly in plastic wrap and allow the fish to cure in the refrigerator for 1 day.
 After a day, unwrap the fish and flip it over, being sure all the flesh comes into contact with the curing mix (which should be mostly liquid at this point). Weight the fish down again and wrap it again in fresh plastic. Cure in the fridge for 3 or 4 more days, depending on the thickness of your fillet. The gravlax is ready when the fish is firm to the touch.
 Wipe the cure off the salmon and wrap it in clean plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve. It will keep for up to a week.
 Pulse the dried onion in a food processor or spice grinder five times, or until powdery. Transfer to a bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and stir well. Store in an airtight container for up to a couple weeks. Give it a good shake before serving.

 First, cook the sweet potatoes. Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 3/4-inch cubes.
 Cut the bell peppers in half, cut out the stems and seeds, and cut the flesh into 3/4-inch cubes, then put them in the roasting pan. Use the back of a knife to lightly crush the 3 garlic cloves and add them to the pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the sweet potatoes to the peppers and put the pan in the oven for 10‚Äì15 minutes, until the peppers have small black patches on the skins.
 Meanwhile, cut up store-bought sausages into bite-sized pieces and cook following the instructions on the package.
 To make the piri piri sauce, peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic. Cut the bell pepper in half and cut out the stem and seeds. Rip the stems from the chiles, cut them in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds if you prefer a milder sauce. Put the onion, garlic, pepper, and chiles in the blender with the paprika, oregano, red wine vinegar, and basil. Grate in the zest of the lemon, then cut it in half and squeeze in the juice, catching any seeds. Add a drop of water and blend to a smooth paste. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
 Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Transfer the sausages and piri piri sauce to the pan and mix everything together. Add the cherry tomatoes and put the pan back in the oven for 15 minutes, until the potatoes and peppers are cooked and the sauce is piping hot.

 About 30 minutes into the roasting of the sweet potatoes, start baking the bacon. Once the bacon is cool, roughly chop it, then set it aside.
 To make the sweet potato pur√©e, I find it easiest to cut the ends off the sweet potatoes, then peel the skin off. Place the roasted flesh into a food processor, then add the coconut milk, vanilla, salt, and, if desired, collagen powder. Pur√©e for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture is smooth. If it‚Äôs too thick, add a splash more of the coconut milk and process again. If you don‚Äôt have a food processor, combine everything in a large bowl and stir it very well with a wooden spoon.
 Divide the sweet potato pur√©e between serving bowls. Top it with the chopped bacon, blueberries, sliced banana, and chopped almonds, and serve.
 The bowls can be assembled ahead of time, but it‚Äôs best to leave the fruit off until they‚Äôre ready to eat. They can be eaten cold or gently reheated."

 Mix flour and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Dredge each wing in the mix until there‚Äôs NO visible moisture on each wing. Shake off excess, then set aside on a plate or rack.
 Pour 2 inches of oil in a pot, or enough to submerge the wings. (If you‚Äôre frying up whole wings‚Äîwhere the drumette, the wingette, and the tip haven‚Äôt been cut apart‚Äîpour in 3 inches.)
 Over high heat, heat the oil to 350¬∞F. Par(tially)-fry the wings for 10 minutes, then remove from pot, and shake off any excess oil. The par-fry cooks the chicken completely through, sealing in the flavor, while starting to form the outside crispy layer.
 Set wings on a paper towel‚Äìlined plate or rack for 5 minutes, or until they cool to room temperature. This prevents the meat from overcooking, while keeping in its moisture.
 OPTIONAL: You can store the par-fried wings in the fridge and do the second wing fry the next day. Just be sure the wings are at room temperature when you fry them.
 Once the wings cool down, reheat the oil to 350¬∞F and fry them a second time for 10 more minutes. The second fry crisps the wings to the point of delicious crunchiness. Remove wings, then shake off excess oil. Brush on or toss wings in a bowl with your favorite sauce.

 In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, and then dump the chicken pieces into the eggs.
 Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet to 350¬∞F. Place a brown paper bag on the counter next to where you are working so you can easily put the chicken on it to drain when you are done frying.
 One piece at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour coating. I like to really press the coating onto the chicken so it gets a super crunchy bite. Start by frying one piece at a time. Remove from the oil after 3 to 4 minutes, when the tenders are golden brown. Place on the brown paper bag. Repeat, frying no more than 4 tenders at a time.
 Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans."

719,Potatoes with Roasted Poblano Chiles and Mexican Sour Cream (Papas con Rajas y Crema √Åcida),"['5 large poblano chiles, stemmed, seeded, and veins removed (or not, depending on how spicy you want this to be)', '2 large Yukon gold potatoes or another waxy potato, cut into 1/2-inch / 12mm cubes', '1 Tbsp sea salt, plus more as needed', '1 Tbsp safflower oil', '1 large white onion, thinly sliced', '1 cup / 240g Homemade Mexican Crema or cr√®me fra√Æche']","On an ungreased comal or in a cast-iron skillet over high heat, roast the chiles, turning them over every couple of minutes using tongs or your hands (carefully, so you don‚Äôt get burned). You‚Äôre looking for uniform blistering, but you don‚Äôt want them to become too soggy in the process, especially if you intend to stuff them, since they need to hold their shape. The process will probably take 10 to 15 minutes. Once they are well blistered and before the flesh is completely charred through in any spots, place the peppers in a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid or in a bowl that you can cover with a plate (not a towel or anything porous) and set aside to ‚Äúsweat‚Äù for about 10 minutes, or until they are cool enough to handle.
 Remove the charred skin from the whole chiles. Once you have removed and discarded the skin and seeds, cut them into rajas, or strips, about the width of fettuccine.
 In a small saucepan, cover the potatoes with 2 inches / 5cm water and add the salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove one of the potatoes and taste it. The piece should be soft but not falling apart, still holding its cube shape. Cubed like this, they will cook quite quickly, so be attentive. Once they have the right texture, drain the potatoes and set aside in a medium bowl with a lid or cover the pan with a plate to keep them warm.
 Using the same comal or skillet in which you toasted your chiles, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it‚Äôs hot but not smoking. Add the onion and saut√© until it‚Äôs translucent but not browned.
 In a saucepan, combine the potatoes, chiles, onion, and crema or cr√®me fra√Æche. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. As the mixture cools, the starches will absorb some of the melted cream and help it firm up. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve as you wish!
 Do Ahead: These potatoes can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."
720,Big-Batch Pancake and Waffle Mix,"['3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces', '6 cups all-purpose flour', '1/2 cup sugar', '4 tsp. baking powder', '4 tsp. kosher salt', '1 1/2 tsp. baking soda']","Place butter on a plate and freeze until very firm, about 15 minutes.

 Heat a waffle iron until very hot; brush with butter. Working in batches and brushing iron with more butter as needed, pour batter onto iron (it should cover the entire surface; the amount of batter will vary according to manufacturer). Cook waffles until golden brown and cooked through, 3‚Äì7 minutes, depending on waffle iron.
 To make a batch of 4 crepes, whisk 2 eggs, 1 cup mix, and 1 cup milk in a medium bowl to combine.
 Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high, then brush with butter. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into skillet and swirl to evenly coat bottom.

Place a slice and a half of cheese on top of each toast, arranging so that spinach mixture is covered.
 Broil toasts until cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 2 minutes (keep a watchful eye on toasts as no two broilers are the same and you don‚Äôt want the toasts to burn)."

Pour into the large bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast and let sit until foamy, 10‚Äì15 minutes. You should see a layer of foam on the surface; this means that the yeast is active.
 Add egg, egg yolk, flour, granulated sugar, cardamom, and salt to yeast mixture and mix with dough hook on low speed until well combined. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gradually add butter 1 Tbsp. at a time, mixing to incorporate slightly before adding more. When 6 Tbsp. butter are incorporated, mix until dough is smooth, supple, and shiny, 10‚Äì15 minutes longer (you need to mix this long to develop the gluten).
 Transfer dough to a large buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 1‚Äì1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down, cover bowl tightly in plastic wrap, and chill overnight (the slow proof creates more flavor because it gives the yeast more time to process the sugar).

Hold one end of strip between a thumb and index finger. Working away from you, tightly wrap strip around 3 fingers. Wrap around fingers again, placing second loop closer to the palm of your hand. As you bring strip across the back of your hand, cross over first loop, angling toward the end of your index finger. Cross dough over front of your hand and tuck the end into the center while removing your fingers and pushing through to the other side to create a knot. Check out step-by-step photos here. You want to twist these tightly so that they rise while baking. If you‚Äôre having trouble, twist them into any kind of knot that you can‚Äîjust make sure it's wrapped tightly.
 Divide cinnamon twists between 2 rimmed baking sheets, spacing evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 45‚Äì60 minutes.

 Meanwhile, add a dash of oil and pat (knob) of butter to another frying pan over medium heat. Add the button mushrooms and saut√© for 3 to 4 minutes, until softened and turning golden. Season with salt and pepper, then remove from the pan and keep warm (adding to the dish with the sausages and bacon). If you are cooking a large flat mushroom, then add the oil and butter to the pan and fry the mushroom for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through, until softened and browned.
 Season the cut side of the tomato halves with salt and pepper and drizzle over 1 tablespoon of oil. Gently fry them, cut side down first, for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn over and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, until just softened.
 Alternatively, cook the large flat mushroom and/or the tomatoes in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400¬∞F (200¬∞C/Gas mark 6). Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil over or add a pat (knob) of butter to the mushroom and season with salt and pepper before roasting for 12 to 15 minutes, until softened. If you are using the oven, begin roasting the mushroom and tomatoes a few minutes before frying the sausages and bacon. Once cooked, decrease the oven temperature to low for keeping everything warm as it is cooked.
 To fry an egg, melt a pat (knob) of butter in a small, clean frying pan over low heat. Carefully crack the egg into the pan and allow to fry gently. For an over-easy egg, fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it begins to set, then flip over and fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer your egg sunny side up, then fry gently for 4 to 5 minutes, until the yolk has filmed over. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the other cooked ingredients.
 For scrambled eggs, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the milk, season with salt and pepper, and beat together. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to a small saucepan over low heat. Immediately pour in the eggs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously (I find a wooden spatula best for this), until the butter has melted and the eggs are softly scrambled. Remove from the heat immediately so that the eggs don't become overcooked. Serve with the other cooked ingredients.
 While the egg is cooking, put the slices of bread in a toaster or toast under a preheated broiler (grill) for a few minutes (and on both sides, if using the broiler/grill) until golden. Butter the toast and cut the slices in half.
 To serve, arrange everything on a warm serving plate, with the hot buttered toast on the side and with some tomato ketchup or relish."

833,Salted Plum Lychee Panna Cotta,"['1 cup water', '2 teaspoons salted plum powder', '6 1/3 teaspoons lime juice', '2/3 teaspoon agar-agar', '1 1/3 teaspoons gelatin powder, or 2 bronze gelatin sheets/leaves (see note)', '1/3 cup plus 1 cup heavy whipping cream', '1 (20-ounce) can lychees or 20 ounces fresh lychees, peeled', '3 2/3 tablespoons milk', '1/4 cup sugar', 'Edible flowers, for garnish (optional)', 'Pomegranate seeds', 'for garnish (optional)']","Because agar-agar is seaweed-based and fairly delicate to work with, this recipe might be one you can‚Äôt multitask until you get a good feel for it. Handle with care, and let‚Äôs hope you don‚Äôt have to frustratingly do it over and over again.
 Heat water and salted plum powder in pot over medium heat. When it starts to steam (not boil!), add lime juice and agar-agar. Whisk until agar-agar dissolves. Continue to whisk for 1 minute, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and pour in a container, then let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate to settle. Once it settles, add to a blender and puree until it forms a thicker saucy consistency. Store in fridge until you‚Äôre ready to bust that bad boy out!
 If using gelatin sheets, add to a bowl of ice-cold water and submerge. Soak (aka let the gelatin bloom) for 5‚Äì7 minutes, or until the sheets soften. To prevent sheets from breaking down, drain water immediately after the 5‚Äì7 minutes and gently wring out remaining water from the sheets, just like you were wringing out a towel.
 If using powdered gelatin, place gelatin in a bowl and add 1/3 cup heavy cream. Let it sit. Let it bloom.
 If using a fun mold to shape and pop out your panna cotta, brush a light layer of cooking oil on the bottom and sides.
 Next, drain syrup from can of lychee (or save for a lychee-flavored cocktail or anything else that could use an ‚Äúinfused‚Äù sugary syrup, yuuuuummers!). Add lychees to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.
 This next step is very delicate because gelatin in any form is fairly unstable, so this may take some trial and error, based on a balance of your heat and your feel for that heat. You‚Äôll know what I mean if you mess up. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a natural-born talent!
 Heat a pot with milk, sugar, and remaining heavy cream on medium-low heat until sugar dissolves and liquid is warm enough to touch. Like the Salted Plum Sauce, the milk, sugar, and heavy cream should steam but not boil. If you have a thermometer, DO NOT go over 145¬∞F.
 Next, add gelatin (sheets or powdered in heavy cream), then whisk until gelatin dissolves. This will take a few minutes.
 Remove from heat, then immediately add lychee puree while the cream is still warm. Mix gently with a spatula.
 Ladle into ramekins, small bowls, your preferred fancy or not-so-fancy container, or into your pre-oil-brushed mold.
 Refrigerate, carefully. Gelatin is fairly docile and irritably unstable. As it cools, however, panna cotta should solidify within an hour.
 If after 2 hours it still hasn‚Äôt settled, don‚Äôt fret‚Äîyou can still recover. Recombine the cream in a pot and warm to right below boiling. Add a tad bit more (bloomed) gelatin, then remove from heat. Repour into molds. Be careful not to add too much gelatin, which will result in a stiff, less creamy panna cotta, more of a superstiff Jell-O than panna cotta.
 Garnish with a thin layer of Salted Plum Sauce on top of your final plating‚Äîdo fancy dots or a paintbrush swipe if you would like‚Äîand edible flowers (if you somehow got these) and pomegranate seeds (if in season and available). Bon appetit, y‚Äôall."

Working in batches if needed, strain through a fine-mesh strainer.
 If not serving immediately, spread rice in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Transfer to resealable freezer bags, pat down into an even layer (so it defrosts more quickly), and freeze up to 4 months. To defrost, transfer frozen rice to a microwave-proof bowl and sprinkle with a bit of water. Cover and microwave rice on high in 1-minute bursts until warmed through.

 Pour the tomatoes and their liquid into the work bowl of a food processor. Using quick on/off pulses, process the tomatoes just until they are finely chopped. (Longer processing will aerate the tomatoes, turning them pink.)
 Stir the penne into the boiling water. Bring the water back to a boil, stirring frequently. Cook the pasta, semi-covered, stirring occasionally, until done, 8 to 10 minutes.
 Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Whack the garlic cloves with the side of a knife and add them to the hot oil. Cook, shaking the skillet, until the garlic is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Lower the work bowl with the tomatoes close to the skillet and carefully ‚Äî they will splatter ‚Äî slide the tomatoes into the pan. Bring to a boil, season lightly with salt and generously with crushed red pepper, and boil 2 minutes. Pour in the vodka, lower the heat so the sauce is at a lively simmer, and simmer until the pasta is ready.
 Just before the pasta is done, fish the garlic cloves out of the sauce and pour in the cream. Add the 2 tablespoons butter or oil, if using, and swirl the skillet to incorporate into the sauce. If the skillet is large enough to accommodate the sauce and pasta, fish the pasta out of the boiling water with a large wire skimmer and drop it directly into the sauce in the skillet. If not, drain the pasta, return it to the pot, and pour in the sauce. Bring the sauce and pasta to a boil, stirring to coat the pasta with sauce. Check the seasoning, adding salt and red pepper if necessary. Sprinkle the parsley over the pasta and boil until the sauce is reduced enough to cling to the pasta.
 Remove the pot from the heat, sprinkle 3/4 cup of the cheese over the pasta, and toss to mix. Serve immediately, passing additional cheese if you like."

Pulse flour, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, and salt in a food processor a few times to combine. Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are pea-size. Add egg yolks and pulse just until dough comes together in small clumps. (Shortbread can also be made by hand: Whisk dry ingredients in a large bowl, then work in the butter with your fingers before mixing in the egg yolks with a sturdy spoon.)
 Transfer dough to prepared pan (you may find it easier to form the dough into a ball first, instead of working with clumps‚Äîentirely up to you!) and press into an even layer. If dough is sticky, use a piece of plastic wrap between your hand and the dough. Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this helps it stay flat as it bakes). Bake shortbread until edges and top are golden brown, 24‚Äì28 minutes. Let cool.
 While the shortbread is baking, use a sharp knife to remove zest from grapefruit in 2""‚Äì3"" wide strips (it‚Äôs okay to leave some white pith attached).

Simmer very gently, still whisking, 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Whisk salt into curd, followed by butter a piece at a time, whisking to fully incorporate after each addition. Scrape curd into pan with shortbread and smooth over crust. Top with some of the candied grapefruit zest (you probably won‚Äôt need all of it; snack on any left over!).
 Bake grapefruit bars until surface of curd is set (the center will still wobble slightly when pan is gently shaken), 20‚Äì25 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until very cold, at least 3 hours, or preferably overnight.
 Just before serving, slice grapefruit bars into 2"" squares and dust with powdered sugar if desired.

 In a medium saucepan, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil. Add the spinach and a pinch each of red pepper flakes, sea salt, and pepper and saut√© for 2 to 3 minutes, until the spinach is slightly wilted. Place the oats in a bowl and top with the spinach.
 In the same saucepan, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and add the egg. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes over medium-high heat, until the egg is golden around the edges and cooked to your liking. Place the egg in the bowl with the oats and spinach. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
 Add the kimchi to the bowl and top the bowl with a few slices of avocado and the hemp seeds. Season with sea salt and pepper to taste and add a hot sauce drizzle if you like."
903,Orange and Poppy Seed Stollen,"['100g butter', '500g plain all-purpose flour', '40g fresh yeast (or 7g active-dry)', '225ml warm milk', '30g sugar', '1 tsp salt', '1 egg', '125g golden raisins', '125g candied citrus peel', '1 medium-sized orange', '4 Tbsp rum or brandy', '1 tsp vanilla extract', '8 green cardamom pods', '2 tsp poppy seeds', '1 tsp ground cinnamon', '50 g blanched, sliced almonds', '200g marzipan', 'A little beaten egg', '50g butter', 'Powdered sugar', 'You will also need a large baking sheet', 'lined with baking parchment.']","Put the sultanas into a mixing bowl. Chop the candied citrus peel into small dice and add to the sultanas. Finely grate the zest from the orange and add to the bowl. Squeeze in the juice of the orange, pour in the rum or brandy and vanilla, then toss together and leave for an hour.
 Melt the butter in a small pan, then leave to cool down. Put the flour into a large mixing bowl. No need to sieve it. If using fresh yeast, warm the milk to body temperature (it should feel comfortable rather than cold or scalding when you insert your finger), then crumble in the yeast and stir to dissolve. Add the sugar and salt to the flour and mix well. Beat the egg. Stir in the egg and the warm milk and butter. (If you are using dried yeast, add the yeast straight to the flour, then stir in the other ingredients followed by the warm milk, egg and butter.)
 Mix thoroughly‚Äîthe dough should be soft, shiny and rather sticky. In all honesty it may be very sticky. Turn out on to a generously floured board and knead for a good eight minutes. As you knead, the dough will become less and less sticky and more like a bread dough‚Äîthough it will be heavier because of the butter and egg. When the dough is soft, elastic and no longer sticking to the board, scoop it up and put it into a floured bowl. Set aside, covered with a clean tea towel, somewhere warm and draught-free for a good hour or until it is well risen. (It won't be quite twice the size of the original dough but well on the way.) Alternatively, mix and knead using a food mixer fitted with a dough hook until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl.
 Break the cardamom pods open and remove their seeds. Crush the seeds to a coarse powder using a pestle and mortar or a spice mill, then mix in a small bowl with the poppy seeds, cinnamon and almonds. Dust the work surface in the flour and tip your risen dough onto it. Knead the spice and seed mixture and the soaked fruits, leaving behind most of the liquid, into the dough.
 Roll into a long loaf about 22cmx16cm and flatten it slightly: Roll the marzipan into a cylinder nearly the length of the dough, then place it in the centre. Brush the edges with a little beaten egg and press together. Turn the dough over and place it on a lined baking sheet, cover with a towel and return it to a warm place to prove for a further hour and a half.
 Heat the oven to 350¬∞F/180¬∞C/Gas 4. Place the loaf in the hot oven and bake for about thirty-five to forty minutes, until pale gold. Melt the butter for the glaze and brush over the loaf. Cool on a wire rack, then dust generously with icing sugar.
 When the loaf is thoroughly cool, wrap loosely in waxed paper or clingfilm and keep in a cookie tin."
904,A  Jolly Good Mince Pie,"['75g unsalted butter', '75g lard', '150g plain all-purpose flour', '1 egg yolk', '375g good-quality mincemeat', 'Powdered sugar, for dusting', 'You will also need a 12-hole tartlet tin', 'each hole measuring 6cmx2cm deep (It is best to bake the pies in a batch of twelve', 'then a second of six.)']","Cut the butter and lard into small pieces and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until you have what looks like coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. If you do this in the food processor it will take a matter of seconds. Add the egg yolk, then mix briefly with just enough cold water to bring to a smooth dough. You will probably need only one or two tablespoons. Bring the dough together into a firm ball, then knead it gently on a floured board for a couple of minutes until it softens. Reserve half of the dough, then roll the remainder out thinly. Set the oven at 400¬∞F/200¬∞C/Gas 6.
 Using cookie cutters or the top of an espresso cup, cut out eighteen discs of pastry: (There may be a tiny bit left over.) Place twelve discs of the pastry in the tartlet tins, reserving six for the second batch, smoothing them up the sides so the edges stand very slightly proud of the tin. Fill each one with a dollop of mincemeat. A level tablespoon is probably all you will get into them, unless you have especially deep tins. Be generous. Roll out the reserved pastry with any leftover trimmings and make a further eighteen discs of pastry, reserving six again. Slightly dampen each of these round the edge with cold water then lay them over each tart and press firmly to seal the edges.
 Using the point of a small kitchen knife cut a small slit in the centre of each pie and bake for twenty minutes until golden. Let them cool for a few minutes, then slide them out of their tins with a palette knife and serve warm, dusted with powdered sugar. Repeat with the remaining pastry discs and mincemeat."
905,Crunchy Chocolate Caramel Layer Cake,"['1 3/4 cups (260g) plain (all-purpose) flour, sifted, plus extra for dusting', '1/4 cup (25g) cocoa powder, sifted', '1/2 cup (80g) icing (confectioner‚Äôs) sugar, sifted', '40g unsalted butter, melted', '1/4 cup (60ml) water', '1 egg', '2 egg yolks, extra', '3/4 cup (165g) caster (superfine) sugar', '1/3 cup (80ml) water', '1/2 cup (125ml) single (pouring/light) cream', '75g unsalted butter, softened', '300g dark chocolate', 'chopped']","Preheat oven to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F). Line 2 large baking trays with non-stick baking paper. Place the flour, cocoa and sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter, water, egg and extra yolks and process until a smooth dough forms. Turn out the dough and bring it together on a lightly floured surface. Divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a very thin rectangle and trim to 10cm x 35cm. Prick each layer all over with a fork and place on the trays. Bake for 8‚Äì10 minutes or until just crisp. Transfer to wire racks and allow to cool at room temperature until crisp.
 To make the chocolate caramel filling, place the sugar and water in a medium saucepan (see note) over medium heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to the boil and cook for 8‚Äì10 minutes or until deep golden in colour. Remove from the heat and, working quickly, add the cream in a thin steady stream. Add the butter, return to the heat and cook, stirring, until well combined. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, pour the caramel mixture over and stir until melted and smooth. Refrigerate until just cold, whisking occasionally. Once cooled, whisk for 1‚Äì2 minutes or until creamy and smooth.
 To assemble, place 1 of the pastry layers on a cake stand or plate. Spread evenly with 1/3 cup (80ml) of the chocolate caramel filling. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling, finishing with a pastry layer. Refrigerate the cake for 1‚Äì2 hours or until set. Slice to serve."
906,Sweet Potato Toasts with Toppings,"['1 large sweet potato, scrubbed (peel if desired, but it‚Äôs not necessary)', 'Toppings of choice (I like almond butter and berries for a sweeter version or avocado and an egg for a savory twist)', 'Pinch of sea salt']","Cut the sweet potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices. Toast it in a toaster (you will probably need two cycles) or in a toaster oven for about 10 minutes, until the potato has cooked through and is golden brown around the edges. Add the toppings of your choice and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Get creative!
 Store any unused ‚Äútoast‚Äù in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheat before serving."
907,Roasted Ducklings in Orange Sauce,"['2 ducklings, about 5 pounds each, giblets saved for the sauce', '1 tablespoon coarse salt', '1 bunch fresh thyme', '1 bunch fresh rosemary', '6 garlic cloves, peeled', '2 oranges, one quartered and seeded; the other sliced in 1/4-inch-thick rounds', '2 to 3 onions sliced in 1/2-inch-thick rounds', '1 bunch carrots, peeled and halved lengthwise', '1/4 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur', '1 teaspoon salt', '2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper', '16 ounces beef or chicken stock', 'Giblets and necks from the ducklings', '2 to 3 tablespoons rendered duck fat (from the roasting ducklings)', '2 tablespoons all-purpose flour', '1/2 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur', '1/4 cup red wine vinegar', '1/4 cup balsamic vinegar', '1/4 cup fresh orange juice', '1 cup orange marmalade', '2 tablespoons thinly sliced orange peel', '1 orange', 'sliced into thin rounds', 'for garnish']","Preheat the oven to 425¬∞F. If convection is an option, choose it.
 Make the ducks. Cut away the flap of fatty skin from the neck, and scrape any loose fat from inside the cavities. Prick the skin all over gently with a sharp fork, or cross-hatch it with a sharp knife. Be careful not to pierce the meat.
 Fill an 18-quart stock pot (or as large as you have) about two-thirds full with water, and add the salt. Place the bunches of thyme and rosemary and the garlic cloves in it. Bring to a rapid boil. (You may need to use two pots if you do not have a single pot large enough to hold both ducklings at once; if so, divide the thyme and rosemary into smaller held-together bunches, and divide the garlic between the pots.) Place the ducks in the pot. If they pop up, keep them submerged using a smaller pot full of water or some other weight. Be aware of overflow. Bring the water back to a slow boil. Simmer the ducks for about 30 minutes. Remove them, and use paper towels to dry them thoroughly.
 Stuff each of the ducks‚Äô cavities with half of the boiled thyme, rosemary, and garlic and the quartered orange.
 Line the bottom of a large shallow roasting pan with the onions, carrots, and the orange rounds. Place the ducks, breast-side down, on top. Massage them with the Cointreau. This will give them a mahogany finish. Let them sit for 10 minutes for the skin to absorb the liqueur. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
 Roast until the bottoms brown, about 20 minutes. Turn them breast-side up, and lower the oven temperature to 350¬∞F. Several times during roasting, spoon off any excess fat as it accumulates, or suck it up using a baster. Use some of the fat to baste the ducks, and set the rest aside, saving some for the sauce.
 Depending on how long you boiled the ducks and the size of the ducks, roasting time will be another hour or longer. The ducks are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers at least 180¬∞F, or until the juices run clear and the leg bones wiggle easily. You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don‚Äôt be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don‚Äôt dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.) Once the ducks are ready, remove them from the oven, and cover them with aluminum foil while you finish the sauce.
 Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the stock, giblets, and necks in a saucepot over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.
 Finish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat‚Äìflour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.
 When the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.
 Place the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side."
908,Instant Pot Butternut Squash Hash,"['1/2 cup 1/4-inch-cubed butternut squash', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 teaspoon olive oil', '1 onion, roughly chopped', '1 bell pepper, roughly chopped', '1/2 teaspoon paprika', '1/2 teaspoon chili powder', '5 rosemary needles, minced', '1 garlic clove, minced', '2 large eggs']","In the Instant Pot, combine the butternut squash, a pinch each of salt and pepper, and the olive oil. Set to ‚Äúsaut√©, medium heat‚Äù and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, stirring often to avoid burning. Add the onion and bell pepper and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes.

 Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar and butter in a large bowl until aerated and pale, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Scrape down sides of bowl, then beat 2 minutes more. Reduce mixer speed to medium, add egg, and beat until well incorporated. Add tea, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat, scraping down sides of bowl, until combined, about 30 seconds more.
 Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in dry ingredients, followed by pistachios. Stir dough a few times with a spatula, making sure to get to bottom of bowl.
 Turn out dough onto a clean work surface and divide into quarters. Working one quarter at a time, place dough on a sheet of parchment paper and pat with your hands into a log, then pull the parchment up around the log and, using the parchment to help contain the dough, press it firmly against your work surface, rotating and squaring off edges until you have a long 1""-thick rectangle. Wrap parchment-wrapped dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours.
 Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325¬∞F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap dough and let sit at room temperature 10‚Äì15 minutes.
 Pulverize raspberries into a fine powder in a food processor or spice mill. Transfer to a plate and mix in sanding sugar.
 Roll dough in raspberry sugar, pressing with your hands to adhere. Using a thin, sharp knife, cut into 1/3""-thick slices, rotating rectangle a quarter turn after each slice to help maintain its shape. Arrange slices on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1/2"" apart. Bake cookies, rotating pans top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until opaque and barely golden, 14‚Äì16 minutes. Transfer pans to wire racks and let cool.

 Add dry ingredients to butter mixture. Mix with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon just until combined. Cover and chill dough until firm, at least 20 minutes or up to overnight.
 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375¬∞F. Place granulated sugar in a shallow bowl. Working with about one-quarter of dough and chilling remaining dough while you assemble and bake, scoop dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls; you should get 10 per batch. It‚Äôs important to bake only 1 sheet of cookies at a time; they‚Äôre very temperature-sensitive and will spread too much otherwise. Roll balls in granulated sugar, then arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2"" apart.
 Bake cookies until centers are cracked and edges are set, 5‚Äì7 minutes. Resist the urge to bake the cookies longer; the aim is to maintain their chew and they will continue to crisp as they cool. If cookies are puffed, tap pan against counter as soon as they come out of the oven to deflate. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes. Remove cookies from pan and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough for a total of 4 batches and 40 cookies.
 Dough can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled. Unfilled cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Using a rubber spatula, scrape the mixture into the lined tin, smooth flat, then gently fold the overhanging pastry sheets to the middle, curling them over as you go to make loose rosettes of pastry. Bake for forty to fifty minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the filling lightly firm to the touch.
 Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Melt the honey in a small saucepan, stir in the candied peel, then spoon over the pastry. Dust with icing sugar and leave to cool before slicing."
952,Roast Pumpkin with Dukkha and Pomegranate,"['700g pumpkin or butternut squash', '4 Tbsp olive oil', '1 Tbsp coriander seeds', '1 Tbsp cumin seeds', '1 Tbsp hemp seeds', '2 Tbsp pumpkin seeds', '2 Tbsp sunflower seeds', '2 Tbsp dried thyme', '1 Tbsp sea salt', '1 Tbsp nigella seeds', '4 Tbsp slivered pistachios', 'A small pomegranate']","Set the oven at 400¬∞F/200¬∞C/Gas 6. Scoop out the seeds and fibers from the middle of the pumpkin or butternut squash. Slice the flesh into thin segments, each about 1cm thick. Lay the pieces out in a single layer on a baking sheet. Trickle over the olive oil and season with black pepper, then bake for about thirty minutes, until soft and translucent.
 In a dry frying pan, mix the coriander and cumin and toast over a low to moderate heat for a few minutes, until fragrant. Add the hemp, pumpkin and sunflower seeds and continue toasting for about five minutes, stirring regularly until all is golden.
 Stir in the thyme and salt, then grind the mixture using a pestle and mortar, cracking the seeds roughly. Keep the mixture rough and knobbly. Fold in the nigella seeds and pistachios. Break open the pomegranate and remove the seeds.
 When the pumpkin comes from the oven, scatter over the pomegranate seeds, about half the spice and seed mixture and serve. Store the remaining mixture in a jar until needed."
953,Big Easy Pumpkin Beignets,"['1 package active dry yeast', '1/2 cup very hot water', 'Pinch of kosher salt', '2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour', '3 large brown eggs', '1 tablespoon cooking oil (peanut, grapeseed, or coconut)', '1 cup canned pumpkin puree', '1/4 cup organic plain whole-milk kefir', 'Vegetable oil, for deep-frying (I use a mix of grapeseed and peanut oil)', '1/2 cup powdered sugar']","Dissolve the yeast in the hot water with the kosher salt. Combine the dissolved yeast with 1 cup of the flour and mix until smooth. Form the yeast/flour mixture into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
 Use a fork to beat the eggs until frothy. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and the cooking oil, mixing well with a wooden spoon or whisk. Once the yeast/flour mixture has doubled in size, combine it with the egg/flour mixture. Stir in the pumpkin puree and kefir and mix until completely smooth.
 Let stand for 1 hour. The dough should be elastic and spring back when stretched. Pour 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil into a deep, straight-sided frying pan and heat the oil to 360¬∞F. (You can test the temperature by dropping in a small amount of the batter. If it immediately starts to bubble and float, the temperature is correct.) Using a soup spoon or a large tablespoon, drop spoonfuls of dough into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Use the spoon to baste the cooking dough with a bit of oil as they fry. Drain the beignets on paper towels, then use a small sieve to dust them with powdered sugar."
954,Dried Fig and Marsala Tart,"['500g dried figs', '50g golden raisins', '100ml dry Marsala', '100g natural raw granulated sugar', '50g butter', '175g cold butter', '225g all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp natural raw granulated sugar', '2 large egg yolks', 'Heavy cream, ice cream, or cr√®me fra√Æche', 'You will also need a 24cm round Tatin tin or shallow', 'non-stick cake tin with a fixed base.']","Set the oven at 400¬∞F/200¬∞C/Gas 6. Put the figs and raisins into a mixing bowl, pour over the Marsala and leave to stand for forty-five minutes, stirring occasionally.
 Cut the cold butter into small cubes and rub into the flour, either with your fingertips or using a food processor. Work until you have what looks like coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.
 Add the egg yolks to the butter and flour. Mix together until you have a soft dough, then turn out on to a floured board and knead briefly, for just a minute. Shape the dough into a smooth, fat cylinder. Wrap it in greaseproof paper or clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for thirty minutes.
 Place the Tatin mould or a frying pan over a moderate heat. (If you will be baking the tart in a cake tin, use a frying pan to make the caramel, otherwise you will damage your tin.) Add the Marsala from the dried fruit, leaving the fruit behind in the bowl, then add the sugar. Bring to the boil and leave to form a thin caramel. If you are using a Tatin mould, remove from the heat. If you are using a cake tin, pour the caramel from the frying pan into the tin.
 Cut the butter into small cubes and scatter it over the caramel. Place the plumped-up figs on the base of the tin in a single layer (neatly or not, as you wish), then scatter over the raisins, pushing them into any gaps.
 Roll out the pastry a little larger than the Tatin mould or cake tin. With the help of the rolling pin‚Äîit is very fragile‚Äîlift the pastry into the mould or tin, pressing it gently into place over the figs. Tuck in any overhanging pastry.
 Bake in the preheated oven for about thirty minutes, until the pastry is golden. Remove from the oven and leave to settle for ten to fifteen minutes. Place a large serving plate on top of the tart, then, using oven gloves, hold the tin and plate firmly and carefully turn them over, leaving the tart to slide out on to the plate. Serve warm with cream, ice cream or cr√®me fra√Æche."

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the leeks, and chopped garlic and stir to coat the vegetables with the oil. Season with salt and pepper and continue to cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook until the wine is reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and let the mixture come to a high boil. Add the clams, working in batches if necessary to ensure that they‚Äôre in a single layer. Cover the pan and cook until the clams have opened. Discard any unopened clams.
 While the clams cook, toast the bread, then rub the surface of each piece of bread with the cut side of one of the remaining garlic cloves.
 Serve the hot clam mixture in a shallow serving bowl with the garlic toast alongside."
956,Brodo di Parmigiano (Parmesan Broth),"['1 pound Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rinds (see note)', '1 small, hard Italian sausage (5 to 7 ounces) such as Creminelli‚Äôs Sopressata, Casalingo, Barolo, or Wild Boar, sliced into 1-inch pieces (vegetarians: omit)', '2 yellow onions, peeled and coarsely chopped', '2 russet potatoes, coarsely chopped', '2 carrots, coarsely chopped', '1 garlic head, halved crosswise', '13 bay leaves', '11 fresh thyme sprigs', '1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns', '1 tablespoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon juniper berries', '1 bunch fresh parsley']","Add everything but the parsley to a large stockpot with 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer so low you see only a bubble every 10 seconds or so. Maintain this simmer for 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
 Add the parsley and simmer for 1 more hour. Strain all of the solids out of the stock with a sieve over a bowl and use the broth immediately, or store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or the freezer for up to 1 month.
 To make a soup-like pasta dish, boil the pasta directly in the broth along with greens such as kale, bok choy, or broccoli.
 To make a thicker sauce to coat noodles, simmer to reduce the brodo by half, then toss it with pasta just before serving."
957,Russian Deviled Eggs,"['6 large brown eggs, hard-boiled, peeled, and halved lengthwise', '1/4 cup organic plain whole-milk kefir', '1 teaspoon wasabi paste', '1 tablespoon mayonnaise', 'Pinch of Maldon sea salt', '8 teaspoons (4 ounces) red caviar (red salmon roe)', 'Fresh dill or parsley', 'for garnish']","Remove the yolks from the eggs and place them in a bowl. Mash them with a fork, then add the kefir, wasabi paste, mayonnaise, and sea salt and mix well. Spoon the mixture back into the egg whites, topping each egg half with about 1 teaspoon of caviar. Arrange the deviled eggs on a platter and garnish with the fresh herbs."
958,Stars Pappardelle,"['1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Green Pea Dough as shown)', 'Flour and semolina for dusting', '1/2 batch dough (your choice of color, Cacao Dough as shown)', 'Kosher salt', 'A star-shaped plunger cutter']","Choose which color of dough you want to be the background color for your stars and roll that dough to the third-thinnest setting on a pasta machine. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the pasta sheet on it. Using a star-shaped plunger cutter in any size you prefer, make star cutouts all over the sheet of pasta. I recommend spacing the star cutouts as close together as possible, because the sheet will get re-rolled and the stars will expand (doesn‚Äôt stars expanding blow your mind?). Cover this sheet with a kitchen towel. If you wish, save the tiny cutout stars to make pastina.
 Roll the second dough on a pasta machine until it is the same size as the sheet with the star cutouts. Uncover the cutout pasta sheet and moisten it slightly with a kitchen brush dipped in water or a damp paper towel. Taking care to cover the cutout sheet precisely, lay the newly rolled sheet over the cutout sheet. Use a rolling pin to sandwich the two sheets together, rolling both lengthwise and crosswise.
 Once you are sure the two sheets are sufficiently pressed together, use a bench scraper to carefully turn the pasta sheet over, revealing the star pattern. You may be able to make nips, tucks, and small adjustments at this point if you notice any bunching up of the pattern. Dust with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
 Roll the sheet through the pasta machine again, starting on the widest setting. Reduce the rollers to the second-widest setting and roll the opposite end of the sheet through first this time. Alternating the sides of the sheet you put through the pasta machine will ensure that the stars don‚Äôt skew too much in one direction. Keep reducing the rollers until you‚Äôve rolled the pasta sheet through the middle thickness on the pasta machine. Your stars will look wide! Don‚Äôt worry; we‚Äôre about to fix that.
 Lay the pasta sheet flat on your work surface and cut the whole sheet crosswise in 5-inch widths (or wider, up to the width of your pasta machine rollers). The star pattern has so far been skewed only side to side, making really wide stars, so now we‚Äôll run the 5-inch sheets crosswise through the pasta machine, to stretch the stars back toward symmetry.
 Feed the 5-inch widths of pasta through the pasta machine crosswise this time, perpendicular to the direction you had been feeding them through initially. Watch the star pattern and stop sheeting at your desired thinness, depending on how stretched or skewed you want the stars. I suggest stopping at the second-or third-thinnest setting.
 Working with one sheet at a time, cut lengthwise strips 3/4 to 1 inch wide. Hang the noodles to rest on a pasta drying rack, dowel, or the back of a chair and repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets.
 Let the pappardelle rest for 30 minutes hanging, then gently place them on a parchment-lined and semolina-dusted sheet pan. You can boil them at this point or wait up to 2 hours at room temperature before boiling. If you would like to cook them another day, after they are leathery to the touch and no longer sticky, store the pasta on a sheet pan covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Increase the cooking time by 1 minute if working with refrigerated pasta.
 Boil in salted water for 2 minutes, drain, dress, and serve immediately."
959,Beet and Fig Salad with Candied Pecans,"['1/2 cup pecans', '2 tablespoons honey', '2 pounds small red beets', '1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil', 'Maldon sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper', 'Juice of 1 lemon', '4 to 6 cups arugula', '1 pint fresh Black Mission figs', '1/2 cup Kefir Labneh']","Preheat the oven to 335¬∞F. In a small ovenproof saut√© pan, combine the pecans and honey and place in the oven. After 5 minutes, stir the pan to evenly coat the pecans with the now-melted honey. After another 5 minutes, stir again. After a final 5 minutes, remove the pan from the oven and empty the nuts out onto parchment paper, making sure to separate each nut so they don‚Äôt stick together once cool.
 Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F. Slice the tops off the beets and wash the beets thoroughly. Toss the beets with enough olive oil to coat (about 1/2 cup) and a pinch each of sea salt and pepper. Place in a shallow roasting pan, add about 1/4 inch water to the pan, and cover with foil. Roast until a small knife easily pierces a beet, 45 to 60 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use your hands and a towel to slide the peels off under cold running water. Cut the beets into wedges and toss them with half of the lemon juice, a pinch of sea salt, and 1/2 cup olive oil. Set aside.
 In a bowl, toss the arugula with a pinch of sea salt and the remaining lemon juice and olive oil and divide among four plates. Add the figs to the bowl that had the arugula and toss with whatever dressing is still in the bowl (give them a good stir to coat). Arrange the figs atop the arugula. Add the beets and pecans to the plates in the same manner and garnish with small dollops of labneh."

 Let pot heat up again for at least 2 minutes before adding beef; season with 2 tsp. salt. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces, then transfer to bowl with bacon. Add remaining chopped onion, garlic, cumin, and paprika to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add harissa and cook, stirring constantly, until it starts to stick to bottom of pot, about 2 minutes. Add stock, potatoes, beans, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, stirring to combine. Return reserved bacon and beef to pot and stir again to combine.
 Lock lid and cook chili at high pressure 40 minutes. Let steam release naturally. Stir chili until most of the potatoes have broken down (they will thicken the chili in the process and become part of the liquid). If chili seems too thick, stir in a little bit of water or more stock to loosen. Taste and season with salt if needed.
 Divide chili among bowls. Top with sour cream, cilantro, cheese, and reserved onion."

 Put oven rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 450¬∞F.
 Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Mix salt and pepper in a small bowl and sprinkle it evenly in turkey cavities and all over skin. Fold neck skin under body and, if desired, secure with metal skewer, then tuck wing tips under breast and tie drumsticks together with kitchen string.
 Put turkey on rack in a large flameproof roasting pan. Roast, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through roasting, until thermometer inserted into fleshy part of each thigh (close to but not touching bone) registers 170¬∞F, 1 3/4 to 2 1/2 hours.
 Carefully tilt turkey so juices from inside large cavity run into roasting pan. Transfer turkey to a platter (do not clean roasting pan) and let stand 30 minutes (temperature of thigh meat will rise to 180¬∞F). Cut off and discard string from turkey.
 Twelve cups of stuffing will fill both cavities and leave you extra to bake separately. Just before roasting, spoon room-temperature stuffing loosely (stuffing expands as it cooks) into the neck (smaller) cavity. Fold the neck skin underneath the body and secure with a small metal skewer. Then loosely fill the body (larger) cavity, and tie drumsticks together. If you don't want any stuffing to spill out, cover the opening with a slice of fresh bread, tucking it inside the cavity before tying the drumsticks. Follow roasting directions above. (Timing for a stuffed bird may be slightly longer, but start checking the temperature at 1 3/4 hours.) Immediately transfer stuffing from body cavity to a shallow baking dish (separate from one for stuffing baked outside the turkey). Take temperature of stuffing in neck cavity and if less than 165¬∞F, add it to the baking dish. Bake (covered for a moist stuffing or uncovered for a crisp top) until it reaches a minimum of 165¬∞F. This can take 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the temperature of the oven, which you may have lowered to reheat side dishes.
 The same method used above can be applied to a whole turkey breast (instead of the entire bird). For a 6- to 8-pound breast (with skin and bone), reduce amount of salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons and pepper to 3/4 teaspoon. Use a V-rack instead of a flat rack. Roast, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through roasting, until thermometer inserted in thickest part of each breast half (close to but not touching bone) registers 170¬∞F, about 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.

Cook 2 minutes (leave bodies in ice water). Add claws back to ice water and let both claws and bodies cool completely. (The lobsters are intentionally undercooked at this point but will finish cooking in the sauce.)
 Remove bodies and claws from ice water. Twist tails off bodies with your hands; discard heads (you won‚Äôt get enough meat to make it worth your time). Working with 1 tail at a time, place on a cutting board and, using a chef‚Äôs knife or cleaver, cut lengthwise all the way through tail in one motion. You should now have 2 even halves. Remove any tomalley or eggs from tails and discard. Remove meat from shells; discard shells. Using the back of a cleaver or a lobster cracker, crack claws on all sides and pick out meat; discard shells. Cut tail and claw meat into bite-size pieces.

Cook, tossing gently and adding splashes of pasta cooking liquid as needed to get sauce to cling tightly to pasta, until sauce and nduja are combined, about 1 minute. Taste and season pasta with salt if needed.
 Add chilled lobster meat to pasta and cook, tossing gently, just until lobster meat is warmed all the way through, about 2 minutes.
 Divide pasta among bowls and top with tarragon and parsley leaves.

1059,Cardamom Knots,"['50g (3 1/2 Tbsp) butter, cubed', '250ml (1 cup) whole milk', '500g (1 lb) white bread flour, plus extra for dusting', '1 (7g) packet fast-acting dried yeast', '1 tsp fine salt', '50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar', '1 tsp ground cardamom', 'Oil, for greasing', '150g (10 1/2 Tbsp) butter, softened', '100g (1/2 cup packed) soft dark brown sugar', '2 tsp ground cardamom', '50g (1/4 cup) granulated sugar', '1/2 tsp ground cardamom', 'Pearl sugar', 'to decorate (optional)']","Start by making the dough. Place the cubed butter in a small saucepan with the milk. Heat over a low heat until the cubes of butter have completely melted, then remove from the heat and set to one side to allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes.
 Place the flour in a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment, and add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt, sugar and cardamom to the other. If you put the salt directly on the yeast it may kill it, which will stop your dough from rising.
 Gradually pour the warm butter and milk into the bowl with the flour,mixing all the time, using your hands or the dough-hook attachment, until a sticky dough forms. You may not need to add all the milk mixture, or you might need to add a little more milk ‚Äì you want to add just enough to make a sticky but not wet dough.
 Dust your worktop lightly with flour, tip the dough out on to it and knead it for 5‚Äì10 minutes (or knead using the dough hook on the stand mixer) until the dough is no longer sticky and has become smooth and elastic. Grease the bowl in which you mixed the dough with oil, place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel or cling film and leave to rise at room temperature for 1‚Äì3 hours or until doubled in size. You can leave the dough to prove in the fridge overnight if you want these for breakfast!
 While the dough is rising, combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl to make a thick paste. Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment.
 Tip the risen dough out of the bowl on to a worktop lightly dusted with flour and fold it in on itself a couple of times to knock out any large air pockets.
 Roll out the dough thinly to make a very large rectangle measuring roughly 50 x 30cm. Spread the cardamom filling mixture all over the dough, making sure it goes right to the edges.
 Fold one of the short ends over two-thirds of the dough, then fold the remaining third over ‚Äì as if you are folding a letter or making puff pastry. You should have one neat rectangle consisting of three layers of dough, and all the filling should be enclosed inside.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even strips. Taking one of the strips, stretch out and twist it a few times. Tie it into a loose knot, tucking the edges in. Place the knot on a lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining strips, arranging them on the tray and leaving a few centimeters between each. Leave for 45 minutes at room temperature to rise again.
 While the knots are proving, preheat the oven to 400¬∞F/200¬∞C/180¬∞C fan/gas 6. Make the cardamom syrup by bringing the sugar, ground cardamom and 50ml of water to the boil in a small saucepan and letting it bubble for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat.
 Bake the buns for 15‚Äì20 minutes or until golden brown, then brush with the cardamom syrup as soon as they come out of the oven. Sprinkle with pearl sugar, if you wish, and serve warm."

Add the cold butter and mix on low until the dough looks like coarse sand. Turn the machine off and blend any large pieces of butter with your fingertips, making sure there are no pieces of butter larger than the size of a pea.
 In a measuring cup, combine the bourbon and ice water. With the stand mixer on low, slowly dribble in the bourbon water 1 tablespoon at a time. Add just enough liquid for the dough to pull away from the sides of the bowl. (You may not need to use all the bourbon water.) Pinch the dough between your fingertips; it should be smooth, not sticky or crumbly. Gently press the dough together and shape into a disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
 In a bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss with your fingertips until the apple slices are coated evenly.
 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough, rotating it in quarter-turns, until 12 to 14 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Gently fit the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edges of the dough with scissors, making sure to leave at least a 1-inch overhang.
 Crack the egg into a small dish. Without breaking the yolk, use a pastry brush to gently coat the bottom and sides of the pie shell with a thin layer of the egg white (reserve the remaining egg). The egg white creates a barrier between the filling and the crust as it bakes, keeping the crust from getting soggy. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
 Spoon the filling into the chilled pie shell. Place 3 bacon slices on top of the filling horizontally. Then, one by one, place the remaining 3 strips vertically, lifting every other horizontal strip to create a basket weave lattice. Crimp the edges by folding the excess overhang inward at a slight angle and pressing down firmly with your thumb.
 Continue crimping the edges all the way around the pie, tucking in the ends of the bacon slices as you crimp the edges. Beat the reserved egg and gently brush onto the exposed edges of the pie dough. Refrigerate the pie for 20 minutes to allow the pastry to set.
 Preheat the oven to 425¬∞F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
 Place the pie on the lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375¬∞F and bake until the crust is golden brown and the bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes.

Using a pastry blender or fork and knife, cut in the butter. Make sure pea-sized butter chunks remain to help keep the crust flaky.
 Lightly beat the egg in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk in the ice-cold water and the vinegar.
 Pour the liquid mixture into the flour-butter mixture, and combine using a wooden spoon. Mix until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass. Be careful not to overmix. Use floured hands to divide the dough in half and then form into 2 balls. Wrap each ball tightly in plastic wrap. Let them chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before rolling out and beginning the sonker recipe.
 Butter and lightly flour a 13x9-inch baking dish (see Note).
 On a floured surface, roll out one chilled dough ball into a large rectangle that will fit into the baking dish. Transfer the rolled-out dough to the prepared baking dish, and press it down gently to line the dish and form the bottom crust. Place the dish in the refrigerator to chill.

 Roll out the remaining dough ball into a rectangle a little smaller than the first. Cut it into strips that are about 1/2 inch wide, and form a lattice crust on top of the sweet potatoes.
 Bake for about 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown (the sonker will not be fully baked at this point).
 While the sonker is baking, prepare the milk dip: Whisk 1/2 cup of the milk with the cornstarch in a medium saucepan, making sure all the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Set the pan over medium-high heat and let it come to a boil. Let boil for 1 minute to thicken. Then remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.
 When the sonker has cooked for 40 minutes, pour 2 cups of the prepared milk dip over the entire surface. Return the sonker to the oven and bake for 15 minutes more or until it is caramelized around the edges and brown on top. Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving; the milk will continue to be absorbed and thicken.
 Serve the sonker just warm, with the remaining milk dip on the side for drizzling."

 Place the rhubarb in a saucepan with the sugar and orange juice. Simmer over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb pieces have completely broken down and the mixture is thick and sticky. Spoon into a small jar or ramekin and leave to cool.
 To make the scones, place the flour in a large bowl and add the cubes of butter. Quickly rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and make a well in the centre.
 Pour the honey into the centre of the well, then gradually add the milk, stirring it into the mixture using a round-ended knife. A soft, rough dough will form. Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead very briefly to smooth out the dough. Over-handling the dough will make your scones tough and flat, so knead as little as possible.
 Gently roll the dough out to a thickness of around 3cm (1 inch). Cut into rounds using a 6cm (2 1/3-inch) pastry cutter, cutting straight down and not twisting, as twisting prevents the scones from rising properly. Very gently re-roll the remaining dough, taking care not to handle it too much, and punch out more scones‚Äîyou should get 9 in total. Arrange the scones on the lined baking tray and brush the tops with a little extra honey.
 Bake for 12‚Äì15 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Serve warm from the oven, split in half, with big dollops of clotted cream and rhubarb compote."

Divide the tin cavity in half by pulling up the center of the parchment and folding a tall pleat to separate the halves. Make sure the pleat is as close to the center as possible.
 Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl for 4‚Äì5 minutes, using a stand mixer or an electric hand-held whisk, until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, adding 1‚Äì2 tablespoons of the flour if the mixture curdles.
 In a separate bowl, combine the flour and ground almonds. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture until a thick batter forms, then scoop half the mixture into a separate bowl.
 Add the lemon juice, lemon zest and a little yellow food coloring to one half of the batter, and do the same to the other half with the lime juice, lime zest and green food coloring, mixing until fully combined.
 Spread the lemon mixture into one half of the tin and the lime mixture into the other half, with the parchment dividing them, and bake for 20‚Äì25 minutes or until risen and golden. Allow the cakes to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
 Use a serrated knife to trim the edges off the cooled sponges. Carefully cut the sides that have colored in the oven, as they can look off-putting if used in the Battenberg. Measure the height of the baked sponge with a ruler and slice the cake into strips the same width as the height, forming a square cross section. Mine are usually 2x2cm (3/4x3/4 inches). This will create perfect squares that stack properly on top of one another.
 Gently warm the lime marmalade in a small saucepan to loosen it and make it easier to spread, then pass it through a sieve. Stick one lemon strip of cake and one lime strip together using some of the lime marmalade, then stack the alternate color on top of the bottom layer to create the checkerboard effect with the four strips.
 Lightly dust the worktop with confectioners' sugar, then roll out the marzipan into a large rectangle, trimming the edges so the rectangle is approximately 18x20cm (7x8-inches). Brush the top and sides of the assembled cake with the remaining marmalade, then place top-side down on to the marzipan along the short edge. Brush the face-up side of the cake with more marmalade before tightly rolling it up in the marzipan until it is covered. Press in the final section of marzipan or trim if it looks too long.
 Trim the ends of the cake using a serrated knife and transfer the Battenberg to a plate or cake stand. The cake will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container."

Add the mashed eggplants and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Take off the heat and let cool.
 Stir the strained yogurt into the cooled mixture. Transfer to a serving dish. Drizzle with the saffron water and sprinkle the chopped walnuts all over. Serve with the bread."
1246,Blackened Salmon with Pineapple Salsa,"['1 tablespoon ground paprika', '1 teaspoon garlic granules', '1 teaspoon dried thyme', 'Pinch of ground cayenne', '1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper', '6 ounces salmon', 'Coconut oil spray', '1/4 cup chopped fresh pineapple', '1/4 cup chopped bell pepper', '1 jalape√±o, seeded and diced', '1/2 cup diced red onion', 'Juice of 1 lime', 'Pinch of salt']","Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.
 In a bowl, combine the blackening seasoning: the paprika, garlic granules, thyme, cayenne, and black pepper. Rub the seasoning onto all sides of the salmon.
 Coat a baking sheet with the coconut oil spray, then place the seasoned salmon on the sheet and bake it for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the salmon is firm but not dry.
 While the salmon is baking, prepare the salsa. Combine all the salsa ingredients in a bowl and let the flavors meld at room temperature until the salmon is ready. Top the cooked salmon with half the salsa, and reserve the other half in the fridge."
1247,Pan-Seared Ribeye with Miso Butter,"['1/4 cup (56 g) unsalted butter, softened', '2 tbsp (39 g) yellow miso paste', '1 tbsp (3 g) thinly sliced green onions', '1/4 tsp black pepper', '2 large ribeye steaks, at least 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) thick', 'Kosher salt, as desired for seasoning', 'Black pepper, as desired for seasoning', '1 tbsp (15 ml) vegetable oil', '1 tbsp (14 g) unsalted butter', '3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped', '1/4 cup (10 g) thinly sliced white and light green parts of green onion', '1/4 cup (10 g) thinly sliced on the bias green onions, for garnish', '1/4 cup (4 g) cilantro leaves', 'for garnish']","For the miso butter, combine the softened butter and miso together in a small bowl. Add the green onions and pepper and combine. Keep at room temperature or roll into a 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) wide log in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cut into slices before serving.
 There is one key difference to this method for thick steaks. The first step is to slightly warm the steaks in the oven before cooking on the stove. Adjust the oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 275¬∞F (135¬∞C). Add your cast-iron skillet to the oven to warm up. I like to use a preheated cast-iron pan because it retains heat very well for searing. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.
 Pat dry the steaks with paper towels, pressing out as much surface moisture as possible. Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Transfer the steaks to the wire rack and place in the oven. The heat helps to dry the free moisture on the surface of the steaks for quicker browning and cook time in the pan.
 Cook the steak until the internal temperature reaches 90 to 95¬∞F (32 to 35¬∞C) for medium-rare, or 100 to 105¬∞F (38¬∞C to 41¬∞C) for medium, about 15 to 20 minutes. The time will vary depending on the thickness of the steaks. Remove the steaks from the oven.
 In the warmed 12-inch (30-cm) cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Carefully add the steaks and sear until browned with a nice crust, about 2 minutes. Flip the steaks with tongs and sear until browned, 1¬Ω to 2 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120 to 125¬∞F (49 to 52¬∞C) for medium-rare or 130¬∞F (54¬∞C) for medium.
 Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic and white and light green parts of green onion. Turn the steaks onto their sides to cook and render any remaining fat, about 1 to 2 minutes. Briefly baste the steaks with the butter, garlic and green onion mixture. Basting the steaks as they cook with oil helps distribute any aromatics like herbs in the pan and evenly browns the surface. The butter is added toward the end to add flavor, mouthfeel and encourage more browning due to the milk protein solids in the butter.
 Immediately transfer the steaks to a clean wire rack set on a sheet pan to rest for 10 minutes. Serve the steaks topped with the miso butter, green onions and cilantro.
 Preheating the steak at low temperature activates enzymes called cathepsins in the meat that help to tenderize the beef, which occurs below 122¬∞F (50¬∞C). The goal with searing is to achieve a quick sear to create a thick brown crust on the steak without overcooking the interior."
1248,Grilled Corn with Hot Paprika Oil and Manchego Cheese (Ma√≠z Rustido),"['1 lime', '3 ears of corn, husks and silk removed', '1 teaspoon hot piment√≥n (smoked paprika)', '4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil', '1 ounce aged Manchego cheese', 'Maldon sea salt']","Heat a grill to high. (As an alternative, you could use a rack set over a gas burner.)
 Trim the top and bottom off the lime. Remove and reserve the zest. Slice between the membranes to release the lime segments. Reserve in a large bowl. Grill the corn, turning to char evenly, until dark brown all over and tender, about 5 minutes. When cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cobs. Transfer to the bowl containing the lime segments and toss until well mixed. Divide among serving dishes.
 Mix the piment√≥n and oil in a small bowl and drizzle all over the corn. Shave the cheese directly over the corn mixture with a microplane, then sprinkle the lime zest on top. Sprinkle with Maldon salt and serve immediately."
1249,Stuffed Flank Steak,"['1 (1 1/2-to 2-pound) flank steak', 'Salt and pepper', '1 cup grated queso asadero', '1/2 cup chopped fresh oregano', '4 cloves garlic', 'minced']","Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium-high direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean. Cut at least ten 8-inch pieces of kitchen twine.
 With a very sharp knife, slice the steak lengthwise into two pieces. With a meat mallet, rolling pin, or the bottom of a cast-iron skillet, pound the two thin steaks evenly to no more than 1/2-inch thick. Pat them dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides.
 Combine the cheese, oregano, and garlic in a small bowl. Divide the mixture between the steaks and spread it out almost to the edges. Roll the steaks up so that the grain of the meat runs the length of the roll, so you‚Äôll be slicing them across the grain. Tie the steaks closed with the twine every 2 inches or so. (You can prepare the recipe to this point up to several hours in advance and refrigerate.)
 Put the stuffed steaks on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, turning the rolls every 2 to 3 minutes for even browning, until 5 to 10¬∞F shy of the desired doneness; start checking them with an instant-read thermometer after 10 minutes. Depending on the thickness of the rolls, they should take 15 to 20 minutes total for medium-rare.
 Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 to 10 minutes, checking the internal temperature. (Or nick with a small knife and peek inside.) Cut the rolls into 1-inch slices, transfer them spiral side up to a platter, pour over any accumulated juices, and serve.
 Stuffed Flank Steak with Mozzarella and Basil: Substitute shredded mozzarella for the queso asadero and omit the oregano. Top the cheese with a layer of fresh basil leaves before rolling; you‚Äôll need 1 cup or more.
 Stuffed Flank Steak with Prosciutto and Rosemary: Substitute Parmesan cheese for the queso asadero and 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary for the oregano. In Step 3, layer 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto over the cheese before rolling.
 Stuffed Flank Steak with Peppery Greens and Goat Cheese: Replace the cheese, oregano, and garlic with 8 ounces goat cheese, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, the grated zest of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (or more to taste), and lots of black pepper, mashed together in a small bowl. Spread the mixture over one side of each of the steaks. Layer 2 cups roughly chopped watercress or arugula over the top before rolling."
1250,Cabbage Wedges with Warm Pancetta Vinaigrette,"['1 small head red or green cabbage (2 pounds or less)', '5 tablespoons good-quality olive oil', '4 ounces thickly sliced pancetta, chopped', '3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar', 'Salt and pepper']","Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean.
 Discard any discolored outer leaves from the cabbage, cut it into 8 wedges, then trim the stem a bit but leave enough on to keep the wedges together. Brush the cabbage on all sides with 2 tablespoons of the oil.
 Put the cabbage on the grill directly over the fire, cut side down. Close the lid and cook until the bottom browns, about 5 minutes; turn and cook the other side. Transfer to a platter.
 While the cabbage is grilling, put the pancetta in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it renders its fat and the meat crisps, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the vinegar and remaining 3 tablespoons oil, and whisk to combine; taste and add some salt and pepper. (You can make the vinaigrette up to a day ahead; refrigerate and gently reheat it before using.) Pour the hot dressing over the cabbage wedges and serve.
 Cabbage Wedges with Warm Bacon-Cumin Vinaigrette: The classic combination: Substitute diced thick-sliced or slab bacon for the pancetta and add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds along with the vinegar.
 Cabbage Wedges with Apple Cider‚ÄìCaraway Vinaigrette: Lose the meat: For the vinaigrette, whisk together 1/2 cup good-quality olive oil, 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon caraway seeds, and salt and pepper to taste. No need to heat it up.
 Ketchup and Soy‚ÄìGlazed Cabbage Wedges: Sweet and salty: Omit the vinaigrette. Instead of olive oil, brush the cabbage with a mixture of 1 tablespoon each good-quality vegetable oil and sesame oil. Combine 2 tablespoons each ketchup and soy sauce and 1 tablespoon each rice vinegar and minced fresh ginger and whisk until combined. Just before taking the cabbage off the grill, brush the glaze on top, close the lid, and cook for a minute; turn and repeat with the other side."
1251,Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables,"['1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar or cider vinegar', '1/2 cup sugar', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 teaspoon mustard seeds', '1 teaspoon coriander seeds', '1 teaspoon black peppercorns', '2 bay leaves', '2 cloves garlic, sliced', '2 pounds vegetables of your choice']","Put the vinegar, sugar, salt, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and add the garlic. When it cools, pour it into a large, nonreactive metal or glass bowl.
 Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium-high direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean.
 Prep the vegetables. Put the vegetables on the grill directly over the fire. (For smaller pieces, use a perforated grill pan, or skewer them to make them easier to handle.) Close the lid and cook the vegetables, turning them as necessary, until they brown deeply on all sides without softening; how long this takes will depend on the vegetable and how hot the fire is, but figure between 5 and 15 minutes total for most vegetables. Stay close to the grill, check them early and often, and move them to cooler parts of the grill to control the coloring.
 As they finish, transfer them to the bowl with the brine. When all are done, toss the vegetables with the brine to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate, tossing the vegetables every 30 minutes so, until the flavor and texture fully develop, at least 3 hours. Serve right away, or keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
 Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables with Chile, Lime, and Star Anise: Perfect with Vietnamese noodles, soups, and salads: For the brine, use 1 1/2 cups rice vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 5 pods star anise. After the liquid simmers, add the grated zest of 1 lime and 1 sliced jalape√±o or Thai bird chile (remove the seeds for less heat).
 Sweeter Quick-Pickled Charred Vegetables with Ginger: Akin to sweet-and-Sour Chinese and Korean pickles: For the brine, use 1 cup each rice vinegar and sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/3 cup thinly sliced or julienne fresh ginger. After the sugar dissolves in Step 1, let the brine bubble gently for another 15 minutes to develop the ginger flavor.
 Spicy Dilly Pickled Vegetables: Terrific made with green beans or okra: In Step 1, substitute 1 tablespoon dill seeds and 2 teaspoons red chile flakes for the mustard and coriander seeds. After adding the vegetables, toss in several fresh dill sprigs if you like."

 Cut the jalape√±os in half lengthwise but leave the halves connected at the stem. With your finger or a pointed spoon (like a grapefruit spoon), remove the seeds and white ribs from the halves. (Wear rubber gloves, or be careful not to touch your skin after handling the chiles.)
 Put the cream cheese and Gouda in a medium bowl with a little salt; mash until combined. Fill the jalape√±o halves evenly with a small spoon and press the halves back together to close. (You can fill and refrigerate the jalape√±os up to a day ahead.)
 Put the jalape√±os on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, carefully turning once, until the peppers have softened and browned (it‚Äôs okay if they char in spots) and the cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve.
 Honey-Orange Jalape√±o Poppers: In Step 3, fill the jalape√±os with a mixture of 1 1/2 cups crumbled fresh goat cheese (6 ounces), 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon grated orange zest, and salt to taste.

Peel the outer layers of each stalk until you reach the tender center. Thinly slice the stalks into coins, then very finely mince. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the pork, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper and mix to combine. Roll into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and set on a rimmed baking sheet. The meatballs can be made beforehand; transfer to a lidded container or tightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use but no longer than 24 hours.
 In a small jar with a lid, combine the fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, garlic, and minced chile. Put the lid on the jar and shake vigorously until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside (the dressing will keep, refrigerated, for up to a week, though it gets spicier as it sits).
 Pour the oil into a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and add the sliced shallots to the cold oil. Line a plate with paper towels and set it nearby. As the oil heats, the shallots will begin to sizzle and bubble; fry, stirring frequently for even cooking, until the shallots begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until they are an even golden brown and crisp (at this stage, they can go from nicely browned to acrid and overcooked very quickly, so be vigilant). Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to the paper-towel- lined plate. Let the oil cool, then pour through a fine- mesh sieve into a clean jar. (Do not discard the oil; it‚Äôs liquid gold, great for another batch of fried shallots or to add flavor to dressings and saut√©ed vegetables, and you can also use it to make a batch of aioli.) The fried shallots can be made in advance. Let cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. Resist snacking on them; they'll keep for about a week.
 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water is boiling add the vermicelli noodles and cook according to package instructions until tender. Drain, rinse with cold water, and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with a tablespoon of the shallot oil (it‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs still warm) and toss to coat.
 Preheat the broiler to high. Transfer the baking sheet of meatballs to the oven, positioning it a few inches from the heating element. Broil the meatballs until browned, about 3 minutes, then roll the meatballs to the second side and broil for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl.
 To serve, arrange the vermicelli on a platter and surround with carrots, cucumber slices, lettuce, mint, and cilantro leaves. Serve the meatballs, dressing, fried shallots, and chopped peanuts alongside. Let the diners dig in, serving themselves some of the noodles, carrots, and cucumbers, garnished with herbs, shallots, and peanuts. Spoon dressing over each serving and top with a few meatballs."

Cook until the sugar melts, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently so the sugar doesn‚Äôt scorch. When the sugar is smooth and completely melted, remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir in the fish sauce. The mixture may seize; if it does, return it to low heat and continue stirring until smooth.
 Preheat the oven to 300¬∞F. In a large Dutch oven over high heat, heat the canola oil. Season the pork pieces on all sides with salt and pepper. When the oil is hot, add some of the pieces of pork and sear until well browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pork. When all the pork has been browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook, stirring, until the shallots are softened, about 2 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, and chilies and cook 1 minute more. Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pot and add the caramel sauce and coconut water. The pieces of meat should poke up above the level of the liquid; if they‚Äôre completely submerged, transfer the meat and liquid to a different pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven.
 After 15 minutes of cooking, uncover the pot; the liquid should be simmering gently. If it‚Äôs bubbling too vigorously, reduce the oven temperature to 275¬∞F. Cook for 70 minutes‚Äîthe meat should be tender but not falling apart. Uncover the pot and continue cooking for 30 minutes more, until the exposed bits of pork are caramelized and the meat is tender.

1315,To Dye Easter Eggs,"['1 teaspoon white vinegar', 'About 20 drops liquid food coloring', 'White-shelled hard-boiled eggs']","Line large baking sheet with paper towels and top with wire cooling rack.

 Striped Easter Eggs: Wrap a portion of the egg with a rubber band before dyeing. Once the egg is dry, remove the rubber band to reveal the white, undyed strip underneath.
 Decal Easter Eggs: Another way to block off portions of the egg: Affix stickers or tape in shapes such as daisies or dots before dyeing. Remove once the egg is dry.
 Free-Hand Easter Eggs: A third way to block off portions: Before dyeing, draw on the egg with a light-colored crayon or wax. If desired, once the egg is dry, the wax can be softened by holding the egg over a candle flame and then wiped off.
 Two-Toned Easter Eggs: All three of the above methods can be used to create two-toned eggs: Dye the whole egg a light color, such as pink, and let it dry. Then wrap the egg with a rubber band, affix stickers, or draw a design in crayon. Dye the egg a second color, such as blue. Once dry, remove the rubber band, stickers, or crayon. The areas blocked off will remain the first color (in this case, pink), while the rest of the egg will turn a combination of the 2 colors (in this case, purple).
 Ombre Easter Eggs: Dip a portion of the egg in one color and another portion in another color. If the two sections overlap, that area will turn a combination of the two colors."

 Remove skin from legs, trying to keep as intact as possible; transfer skin to an airtight container. Cover and chill. Pull duck meat from bones, tearing into 2"" pieces; discard bones and cartilage. Place meat in another airtight container; cover and chill. You won‚Äôt need the skin, meat, or fat until you‚Äôre ready to assemble the cassoulet.
 DO AHEAD: Duck legs can be confited 3 weeks ahead. Transfer legs to a large nonreactive vessel; strain fat through a fine-mesh sieve over meat. Cover and chill. Let come to room temperature before using. Meat and skin can be prepared 3 days ahead; keep chilled.
 Cook the beans:
 Stick a clove into each onion half. Place in a large pot along with beans, pancetta, carrots, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf; pour in cold water to cover beans by 2"". Season with several grinds of pepper [3] and bring to a gentle simmer. Partially cover pot and cook beans, skimming surface occasionally and adding more water as needed to keep beans submerged and seasoning with a couple of pinches of salt after about 30 minutes, until beans are tender but not falling apart, 45‚Äì60 minutes for cannellini and 1‚Äì1¬Ω hours for Tarbais or corona. Remove pot from heat; pluck out and discard onion, carrots, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Transfer pancetta to a cutting board; let cool slightly, then cut into 1x1/4"" pieces. Add back to pot and let mixture cool.
 Cook ragout:
 Meanwhile, sprinkle pork with 1 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt and several grinds of pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high. Working in 2 batches, cook pork, turning once, until browned all over, 10‚Äì12 minutes per batch; transfer to a plate as you go.
 Reduce heat to medium and place onion, carrot, and garlic in pot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 8‚Äì10 minutes. Return pork to pot and add thyme, bay leaf, tomatoes, and stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, partially cover pot, and simmer gently, skimming fat occasionally, until meat is fork-tender, 1 3/4‚Äì2 hours. Pluck out and discard thyme and bay leaf. Let ragout cool slightly.
 Combine beans and ragout:
 Using a slotted spoon, transfer bean mixture to pot with ragout. Add enough cooking liquid from beans just to cover. Pour remaining bean cooking liquid into an airtight container and chill; you may need it for finishing the cassoulet later. Let ragout mixture cool completely, then cover and chill at least 12 hours.
 DO AHEAD: Ragout and beans can be combined 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
 Temper and season ragout mixture:
 Remove ragout mixture from refrigerator and skim fat from surface; discard. Cover pot and bring ragout to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Taste and season conservatively with salt and pepper if needed (the duck will add considerable saltiness when mixed in).
 Prepare sausage and breadcrumbs:
 Remove reserved duck meat and skin from refrigerator. Let meat come to room temperature.
 Meanwhile, arrange skin in a single layer in an 8-qt. Dutch oven or other heavy pot (the same one you‚Äôll cook the cassoulet in). Cook over low heat, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 20‚Äì30 minutes. Using tongs, transfer skin to paper towels and blot away excess fat.
 Prick pork sausages all over with a fork and cook in fat in same pot, turning occasionally, until browned all over and cooked through, 12‚Äì15 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool slightly. Cut into 2"" pieces.
 Add breadcrumbs to pot and cook, stirring often, until golden in spots and starting to crisp, about 5 minutes. If breadcrumbs seem very dry or are sticking to the pot, add 1‚Äì2 Tbsp. reserved duck fat. Transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl and let cool slightly. Add parsley and toss to combine. Wipe out pot and let cool.
 Layer cassoulet:
 Rub inside of cooled pot with cut sides of garlic; ladle in one-third of ragout mixture. Top with half of pork sausage, garlic sausage, and duck meat, then another third of ragout mixture. Top with remaining duck meat and sausages, then remaining ragout mixture. Liquid should come to top of beans. Add reserved bean cooking liquid if needed.
 DO AHEAD: Cassoulet can be assembled 1 day ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before proceeding. Store breadcrumbs and duck skin separately airtight at room temperature.
 Bake cassoulet:
 Preheat oven to 375¬∞F. Scatter two-thirds of breadcrumb mixture over cassoulet.
 Bake, uncovered, until a golden crust forms, 25‚Äì30 minutes. Remove from oven and use a spoon to break up crust, pressing very gently so crust absorbs a little liquid; smooth surface. Bake until another crust forms, 25‚Äì30 minutes; break up again. Repeat process 2 more times (for a total of 4 times). If mixture starts to look dry, moisten with a bit of reserved bean cooking liquid when breaking up the crust.
 Top cassoulet with remaining breadcrumb mixture; bake until golden brown, 15‚Äì20 minutes. Let rest at least 25 minutes before serving.
 Divide cassoulet among bowls; crumble duck skin over."

1379,Cassava Bacon,"['1/4 cup low-sodium tamari or soy sauce', '2 tablespoons maple syrup', '1 tablespoon liquid smoke', '1 teaspoon smoked paprika', '1 cassava root', '1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil', 'for frying']","Combine all of the marinade ingredients together in a bowl or wide dish with a whisk or fork.
 Peel the tough brown waxy skin from the cassava and discard. Your cassava root should be firm and white, not gray or mushy. That is a sign of spoilage.
 Using the peeler or a mandolin, shave off thin strips of cassava about 1 1/4 inches wide to resemble strip bacon.
 Marinate the strips for 15 minutes.
 Heat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat with a small amount of oil. When the pan is hot, place 4 or 5 strips into the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side and 2 to 3 minutes after flipped. You may need to lower the heat so the pan doesn‚Äôt get too hot and burn the bacon. Once or twice while frying a batch, add a little bit of the excess marinade to help caramelize the bacon. Also add more oil to the pan before frying each batch.
 Remove the fried strips from the pan and set on a plate. Placing the strips on paper towels isn't advised, as they will stick.
 The bacon lasts up to 2 weeks stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. Warm up leftover strips in the oven or in a pan on the stove before serving with recipes."

Place in a high-powered blender with the nondairy milk, nutritional yeast, tapioca flour, turmeric, garlic and onion powders, salt, and pepper. Blend on high until smooth. The batter should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Add a bit more nondairy milk if you need to thin it out. Stir in the chopped chives.
 Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add a bit of vegan butter. Let it melt and spread it around the frying surface. Pour approximately 1/3 cup of the batter onto the pan and gently spread out to a 6-to 7-inch circle. Cook on the first side for 4 to 5 minutes; the patty should be bubbling and look slightly cooked through and darker in color before flipping. Flip and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes. Fold the patty in half and then in half again, so it looks like you‚Äôve folded a thick crepe, and cook for another minute on each side to make sure that the middle is thoroughly cooked. Set each folded patty aside on a plate and cover to keep warm. Butter the pan before pouring the next 1/3 cup of batter into the pan. As you go, you might need to lower the heat or adjust cook times, as the pan will get hotter.
 When you‚Äôre on your last egg patty, set the oven to broil and place the English muffins on a baking sheet. Generously butter each side of the muffins and place 1 piece of cheese on each of the bottom halves. Toast under the broiler for a couple of minutes until the cheese is melted and the muffins are golden brown. Watch closely so the muffins don‚Äôt burn!
 Place the bacon strips in the pan once the egg patties are done just to heat through.
 To assemble each sandwich, place an egg patty on top of the cheese, add a tomato slice and as many bacon strips as you want, and finish with the top half of the muffin. The patties can be made ahead and heated through in a pan or the oven or in a microwave before serving. You can also store extra batter in the fridge for up to 4 days."

Cook for 3 minutes at a rapid boil; then remove from the heat. Add the ice and wait for the brine to cool to room temperature.
 Place the brisket in a large container and cover it fully with the brine. (If you have an extra-large sealable plastic bag, those work really well, keeping the meat fully immersed in the brine.) Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for 1 week.
 After that week, remove the brisket from the brine and strain the brine, saving the spices and bay leaves and discarding the liquid. Set the brisket aside on a plate.

Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes.
 Cover the slow cooker and reduce the heat to LOW. Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160¬∞F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165¬∞F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.
 Turn off and uncover the slow cooker and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler on high and position a rack 6 inches from the heat source (if that‚Äôs how your broiler works). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. In a small bowl mix together the honey and remaining 1/4 cup miso.
 Using tongs slung through the cavity of the chicken and your hands to support it, carefully transfer the chicken from the slow cooker to a cutting board, leaving the drippings behind. Remove the potatoes from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and put them on the prepared baking sheet. Carve the chicken and put the pieces on the baking sheet skin side up. Drizzle the chicken all over with the miso-honey mixture, then broil the potatoes and chicken until the chicken skin is caramelized and crisp, dark golden brown, about 5 minutes. (Don‚Äôt walk away; the skin will burn quickly because of the sugar in the honey.)

1445,Kefir-Battered Cast-Iron Fried Chicken,"['1 1/2 cups organic plain whole-milk kefir', '1 cup kosher salt', '1 whole organic chicken (about 3 pounds)', '1 1/2 cups grapeseed oil', '1 cup panko breadcrumbs, crushed', '1/2 cup organic whole wheat flour', '1 tablespoon smoked paprika', '1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper', '1 teaspoon cayenne pepper', 'Pinch of Maldon sea salt']","In a bowl, mix the kefir with 1/2 cup of the kosher salt. Set aside.
 Trim and cut the chicken into 10 pieces: 2 drumsticks; 2 thighs; 2 wings; and 2 breasts, each cut in half (leave the breasts on the rib cage). Pat all the pieces dry with a paper towel, then add the chicken to the kefir mixture. Cover and let sit overnight in the refrigerator. When ready to cook, pull the bowl out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking.
 Preheat the oven to 425¬∞F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet near the stove.
 Place a 9-inch cast-iron pan on the stovetop and pour in the grapeseed oil. Begin warming the oil over medium-high heat. In a bowl, mix together the panko, flour, paprika, black pepper, cayenne, and remaining 1/2 cup kosher salt.
 Remove one piece of chicken at a time from the kefir marinade and dredge it in the panko/flour mixture, making sure that all surfaces are covered. Lift the piece of chicken up, gently shake it off, and place on a plate. Repeat until all chicken pieces are coated.
 Take a small amount of the panko/flour mixture and place it in the hot oil in the cast-iron pan. It should bubble up around the sides and brown slowly. If it browns too quickly, turn the heat down and wait a few minutes and try again. If it does not bubble at all, turn the heat up, wait a few minutes and try again.
 Once the oil is at the right temperature, place about half of the chicken pieces in the pan, leaving room between the pieces. You should be able to fry all the chicken in two batches. When one side of a piece of chicken is brown, 7 to 10 minutes, gently flip it in the pan using tongs or a slotted spatula. Repeat on the other side until golden brown. Remove each piece from the pan once browned and place on the rack in the baking sheet. Repeat until all pieces are browned. Place the baking sheet pan in the oven and bake for about 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle each piece with a touch of sea salt."

Add the shiitake slices, spreading them evenly around the pan. Now leave those mushrooms alone! Do not touch them until that sizzling sound quiets down; this will help them develop a beautiful golden brown caramelization on one side. Once that happens, give the pan a stir with a wooden spoon, loosening all the mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes more and season with a pinch of sea salt. (Do not salt until the end, as salting draws out moisture in the pan and prevents caramelization.) Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside in a bowl or plate to cool.
 Trim the kale off of its stem and cut into thin strips. In a medium saut√© pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and red onion. When the garlic is slightly browned, add the kale and saut√© until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. (Add a small amount of water if the kale begins to stick or turn too brown.) Season with a pinch of sea salt and set aside with the mushrooms.
 Preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Place a large shallow nonstick ovenproof dish in the oven.
 In a bowl, whip the eggs with a whisk until fully beaten and slightly fluffy. Stir in the kefir, 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the farmer cheese, cooked mushrooms, saut√©ed kale, chopped herbs, and 2 pinches of salt. Pour the entire mixture into the heated ovenproof dish, and bake until slightly browned on top and a knife stuck in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Slowly stir in the polenta with a whisk, then reduce to a simmer. Continue stirring this mixture until all of the lumps are smoothed out and the polenta is fully incorporated. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour‚Äîthe polenta should bubble slightly‚Äîstirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. (Be sure to scrape the bottom as you go, to prevent sticking.) Toward the end of the simmering, remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the kefir.
 While the polenta is cooking, in a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the porcinis, evenly distributing them over the bottom of the pot. Let the mushrooms sit, without stirring, until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. (Do not stir them too early; listen for the sizzling sound of moisture evaporating before stirring.) Once the moisture has evaporated, give them a quick stir, then remove the pan from the heat.
 Ladle the polenta into a medium/large shallow bowl, topping with the mushrooms and pecorino cheese. Sprinkle the entire platter with the truffle salt or the truffle oil or shave the fresh truffle over it; don‚Äôt use more than one of these options or it will overpower the dish. If not using truffle salt, sprinkle with a generous pinch of Maldon sea salt."

 Combine the salt, pepper, and ground fennel in a small bowl. Generously season the roast with the spice mixture.
 Add enough oil to a large Dutch oven to coat the bottom. Heat it over medium-high heat, add the roast, and sear 8 to 10 minutes total, turning to brown all sides. Transfer the roast to a bowl.
 Add the carrots, onions, and garlic and season lightly with salt and pepper. Saut√© the vegetables until browned, 5 to 8 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic. Remove the vegetables and place in a clean bowl.
 Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of the cider. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any brown bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Add 2 cups of the broth and bring it to a boil again.
 Add 4 sprigs of the thyme, the rosemary, bay leaf, and roast to the pot (reserving the vegetables in the bowl). Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.
 Cover the pot, place it in the oven, and roast for 2 hours. Add the reserved vegetables and roast for 1 more hour, until the roast is fork-tender but not mushy.
 Remove the roast and vegetables to a large bowl or platter and cover to keep warm. Let the braising liquid cool slightly, then strain the liquid into a bowl (discard the solids).
 Skim off any fat that has risen to the top.

 In many pot roast recipes, there is an element of alcohol. In mine, I use hard cider, but you can also try red wine, a heavy beer, or‚Äîfor your Irish friends‚ÄîGuinness. The booze gives the meat an extra dimension but won‚Äôt get the family hammered."

Stir in the oil, oyster sauce, fish sauce, turmeric, and the 1/3 cup coconut milk and mix well. Reserve 1/4 cup of this mixture and set aside. Transfer the rest to a large mixing bowl and add the short ribs. Toss the ribs to coat, cover the bowl, and let them marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours (you can get away with marinating for 6 hours at a minimum, though the satay will have less depth of flavor).
 When it is time to cook the ribs, preheat your grill until very hot. I highly recommend cooking satay on an outdoor grill over charcoal briquettes, but gas will suffice (cook them indoors in a grill pan only if you have a very good exhaust system, since they generate a lot of smoke). Make the baste by mixing the reserved 1/4 cup marinade with the 1/3 cup coconut milk. Grill the ribs for about 2 minutes on each side (a little more or less, depending on how you like your meat). As they cook, brush the ribs with the basting liquid and a sprinkling of salt. Let the cooked ribs rest for 2 minutes before serving with the satay peanut sauce and cucumber ajat. Accompany with jasmine or sticky rice or slices of toasted white bread."

 Carefully unwrap the bread and dig right in!
 Make a pizza version: Add chopped pepperoni, diced green bell pepper, and spoonfuls of marinara sauce.
 How about a French onion version? Diced caramelized onions, Gruy√®re cheese, and chopped chives. Drizzle on beef broth instead of butter. Yum!

Use a large spoon to make 4 to 6 indentations in the rice and carefully crack an egg into each. Put the pan in the oven and roast, undisturbed, for 15 minutes. Check to see if the rice is dry and just tender. If not, return the pan to the oven for another 5 minutes. If the rice looks too dry at this point and still isn‚Äôt quite done, add a small amount of stock, wine, or water. When the rice is ready, turn off the oven and let it sit for at least 5 and up to 15 minutes.
 Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. If you like, put the pan over high heat for a few minutes to develop a bit of a bottom crust before serving.
 Instead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound eggplant, peeled if you like, and cubed. In Step 1, increase the oil to 2 tablespoons.
 Instead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound fresh mushrooms like cremini (sometimes called ‚Äúbaby bellas‚Äù) or shiitake. Trim the stems and save them for another use, but leave the caps whole. Proceed with the recipe, putting the caps on top of the rice, smooth side up.
 You‚Äôll have to pile the spinach up on top of the rice, but it will cook down and form a lovely green topping: Instead of tomatoes and eggs, use 1 pound fresh spinach, rinsed, trimmed of thick stems, and chopped. When you put it in the bowl with the olive oil, add 1 tablespoon minced lemon zest.
 You could also make this with limas or edamame: Instead of the tomatoes and eggs, use 1 cup shelled and peeled fava beans (frozen are fine)."

Scrape into a medium bowl; set aside. Save mixer bowl because you‚Äôre going to use it again in a minute (no need to wash).
 Gently heat milk in a small saucepan over low until warm to the touch but not steaming hot. It should be 110¬∞F‚Äì115¬∞F. Whisk milk and yeast in a small bowl to dissolve yeast, then let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
 Meanwhile, whisk flour, sugar, and salt in reserved mixer bowl to combine. Add yeast mixture and eggs, fit bowl back onto mixer, and beat on low speed with dough hook, gradually increasing mixer speed to medium as dry ingredients are incorporated, until dough comes together around hook. Continue to mix on medium speed until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Add more flour by the tablespoonful as needed if dough isn‚Äôt pulling away from bowl cleanly.
 With motor running, gradually add reserved butter about a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until it is absorbed before adding more. This process can take several minutes, so be patient. When you‚Äôre done adding the butter, the dough will be extremely smooth, soft, and supple but not sticky. Place dough in a large buttered bowl and cover. Let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, 55‚Äì65 minutes.
 Uncover dough and punch down several times to deflate. Line a 13x9"" baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving generous overhang on all sides. Place dough in pan and press into an even layer, working all the way to the sides of the pan. Fold plastic up and over dough, eliminating air pockets between dough and plastic. Chill dough in freezer until firm to the touch, 20‚Äì30 minutes.
 Mix granulated sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Lightly brush tube pan with butter. Sprinkle with sanding sugar, tapping out excess; set aside. Remove dough from freezer and peel back plastic. Brush entire surface with melted butter and sprinkle generously with some cinnamon sugar. Shake excess sugar back into bowl, then invert baking pan and turn out dough onto work surface sugar side down. Remove plastic; discard. Brush other side of dough with butter and sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Use a pizza cutter or a chef‚Äôs knife to cut dough into a 12x6 grid.
 Working relatively quickly so dough doesn‚Äôt become too soft, separate pieces and, working one at a time, roll lightly between your palms into balls, dusting with more cinnamon sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Place in prepared tube pan as you go. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until pieces have swelled to nearly doubled in size, 40‚Äì50 minutes. Preheat oven to 350¬∞ a little before monkey bread is ready to bake.
 Remove plastic from pan and bake monkey bread until golden brown, 25‚Äì35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula to loosen monkey bread from sides of pan. Pull bottom out from pan and use spatula to loosen bread from bottom. Slide bread back into pan; invert onto a plate and remove pan. Place a wire rack over bread and invert right side up onto rack. If using a Bundt pan, just invert directly onto wire rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
 Pour about 1/2 cup caramel sauce over monkey bread if desired. Serve with more sauce alongside for dipping.
 Dough can be made 1 day ahead. After punching down, pat into plastic-lined pan and chill in refrigerator instead of freezer."

1523,12-Minute Saucy Chicken Breasts with Limes,"['2 teaspoons ground cumin', '2 teaspoons ground turmeric', '1 teaspoon paprika', '1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more', '1 whole skin-on, bone-in chicken breast (about 1 1/2 pounds), split', '1 tablespoon olive oil', '2 limes', 'halved']","Place a 10"" cast-iron skillet in oven; preheat oven to 475¬∞F. Lay your hands on another heavy skillet or saucepan the same diameter or smaller and tear off an 8"" piece of foil; set aside near stove.
 Mix cumin, turmeric, paprika, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl. Brace yourself: This next step requires some light butchery, but it‚Äôs easy. Place chicken skin side down on a cutting board and find the short row of small rib bones near the outer edge of the breast. Grip them with your fingers and pull them off (or use a paring knife or shears). Next: along the center line where the breast was cut in half, there‚Äôs a dark, vaguely rectangular bone‚Äîit almost looks like an anvil. Sometimes it‚Äôs in one piece, or both sides will have a half of it. It doesn‚Äôt matter: Grip the bone with your fingers and pull it out, then tease out the strip of flexible cartilage just below it. All done! Now the chicken will lay flat in the pan, which is why it cooks so quickly.
 Season both sides of chicken with salt, then with all of the spice rub. Remove hot skillet from oven and set over medium-high heat. Add oil, then lay chicken into pan, skin side down. Use a spatula to firmly press chicken against surface, then add 1 lime to pan, placing sides down. Cook until skin is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven, lay reserved foil over chicken, then weight with second pan. Cook 10 minutes.
 Remove pan from oven and turn chicken over; cook second side in residual heat 1 minute. Squeeze juice from cooked limes into pan; transfer chicken and pan juices to a plate and serve with remaining lime halves."

1544,Not-Quite-Bonnie's Rugelach,"['1 1/4 cups (160 g) all-purpose flour', '1/8 tsp salt', '1/4 tsp baking powder', 'Finely grated zest of 1 small lemon (3/4 tsp)', 'Scraped seeds of 1/4 vanilla pod', '1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp (125 g) unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut roughly into 1-inch/3-cm cubes', '4 1/2 oz (125 g) cream cheese, fridge-cold', '1/3 cup (40 g) walnut halves', '1/2 packed cup plus 1 tbsp (100 g) light brown sugar', '1/2 tsp ground cinnamon', '5 1/4 oz (150 g) store-bought quince paste (membrillo)', '1 tsp lemon juice', '1 large egg, lightly beaten', '1/2 tbsp demerara sugar']","To make the pastry, place the flour, salt, baking powder, lemon zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse for about 15 seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse for a few seconds more, until the mixture has the texture of fresh breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese and process just until the dough comes together in a ball around the blade; be careful not to overprocess or the pastry will be tough. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds, just to bring it together.
 Divide the pastry in two, cover each half loosely in plastic wrap, then press to flatten into disks. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour.
 Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F/180¬∞C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
 To make the filling, spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool, then chop finely and place in a small bowl with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix together and set aside.
 In a separate bowl, combine the quince paste and lemon juice to form a smooth paste. (If your quince paste is very firm, warm it gently over low heat to soften [or heat for 10 seconds in a microwave], until the texture is thick like jam but spreadable, then set aside to cool before using).
 Take one of the pieces of dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 9 1/2-inch/24-cm circle, about 1/8 inch/3 mm thick. Use a small spatula or the back of a spoon to spread half of the quince paste evenly over the surface and then sprinkle with half of the sugar-nut mixture. Using a sharp knife or a pizza wheel, if you have one, cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into twelve equal triangles. The best way to get even-sized triangles is to cut it first into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge quite tightly, starting from the wide outside edge and working toward the point of the triangle, so that the filling is enclosed. Place them on the lined baking sheets, seam side down, spaced about 1 inch/3 cm apart. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining disk of dough and filling, then chill the rugelachs in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking.
 Increase the oven temperature to 400¬∞F/200¬∞C.
 When ready to bake, lightly brush the tops of the rugelachs with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 20‚Äì25 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden brown all over. Don‚Äôt worry if some of the filling oozes out; this will add a lovely toffee taste to the edges of the cookies. Remove from the oven and allow to rest on the sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
 The pastry can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, or frozen for up to 3 months (remember to thaw it overnight in the fridge before using). The rolled rugelach can also be frozen (before glazing) for up to 3 months. When you are ready to bake them, brush with the glaze and bake from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.
 These will keep for up to 4 days in an open container, separated by pieces of parchment paper, and the whole thing wrapped loosely in aluminum foil. Don‚Äôt keep in an airtight container; the sugar will weep if you do and turn the rugelach soft and sticky."
1545,Spiced Praline Meringues,"['1/3 cup (50 g) blanched slivered almonds', '1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar', '2 tbsp water', '1/2 tsp ground cinnamon', '1/8 tsp ground cloves', 'Finely grated zest of 1 large orange (1 tbsp)', '1/4 tsp flaky sea salt', '5 1/4 oz (150 g) egg whites (from 4 large eggs)']","Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C.
 Spread the almonds out on a small rimmed baking sheet and roast in the oven for 5‚Äì7 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
 Place 1/4 cup/50 g of the sugar in a small saucepan with the water and stir to combine. Cook over high heat for about 4 minutes, until it has turned a light golden brown; do not stir, just gently shake the pan to help the sugar dissolve. Add the almonds and cook for 1 minute, so the nuts are coated and the caramel turns dark, without burning. Pour the mixture onto one of the lined baking sheets and set aside until cool.
 Once cool, break the praline into smaller pieces, place in a food processor and process to form a rough powder. Remove from the machine, place in a shallow bowl and combine with the spices, orange zest and salt. Set aside.
 Spread the remaining sugar out on the second lined baking sheet and place in the oven for 7 minutes, until the sugar is hot. Remove from the oven and lower the temperature to 275¬∞F/130¬∞C. As soon as the sugar is out of the oven, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on high speed until they begin to froth up. Carefully add the hot sugar to the egg whites, 1 tbsp at a time, and continue beating for 7‚Äì8 minutes until the mixture is completely cold. At this point it should be silky and thick and keep its shape when you lift a little bit from the bowl.
 . Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Use an extra-large serving spoon to scoop up some meringue, and use another large spoon to help shape it into a rough ball the size of a large apple. Sprinkle some praline over half the meringue ball, then place on the baking sheet, repeat with the rest of the mixture, spacing the balls as far apart as possible, as they will increase in size.
 Place the meringues in the oven for 2‚Äì2 1/2 hours. Check that they are done by lifting them from the baking sheet and gently tapping to make sure the outside is completely firm and the center is only a little soft. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking sheet to cool.
 These will keep for up to 10 days. If you are not hanging them on the tree, wrap them loosely in aluminum foil and keep at room temperature."
1546,Soft Gingerbread Tiles with Rum Butter Glaze,"['6 tbsp (85 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1/3 packed cup plus 2 tbsp (90 g) dark brown sugar', '1/4 cup (100 g) blackstrap molasses', '1 large egg yolk', '1 3/4 cups plus 2 tbsp (235 g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for pressing', '1 tbsp Dutch-processed cocoa powder', '1/2 tsp baking soda', '1 tsp ground ginger', '1/2 tsp ground cinnamon', '1/8 tsp ground cloves', '1/4 tsp salt', '1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper', '""2/3 cup (80 g) confectioners sugar"", 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon', '1 tbsp (15 g) unsalted butter, melted and warm', '1 tbsp dark rum (or lemon juice)', '1 tsp warm water']","Place the butter, sugar and molasses in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed until smooth and incorporated. Add the egg yolk and continue to beat until fully combined.
 Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt and pepper into a bowl. Turn the speed of the mixer to low, and add the dry ingredients to the butter and molasses. Once the mix comes together, tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently. Roll out the dough so that it is about 1/4 inch/ 0.5 cm thick. If the dough is very soft, you will need to chill it.
 Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
 Dip the cookie stamps in a small bowl of flour, shake off any excess and then press them firmly into the dough, one at a time, to create a deep imprint. How far you need to press to get an imprint will depend on your stamp; the patterns on some are more deeply cut than others. Bear in mind that the cookies rise a little when cooked, so any soft imprints will disappear. Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly larger than the pattern, cut out the pieces of imprinted gingerbread. Transfer the cookies to the lined baking sheets, spaced about 3/4 inch/2 cm apart. Reroll the dough and continue to stamp and cut cookies until all the dough is used up.
 Bake for 9‚Äì10 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until firm to the touch. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so don‚Äôt be tempted to bake them for any longer.
 To make the rum butter glaze while the gingerbreads are in the oven, as the glaze needs to be brushed onto the cookies while they are still warm, sift the confectioners‚Äô sugar and cinnamon into a small bowl. Add the melted butter, rum (or lemon juice) and water and mix with a spoon until smooth. The glaze will thicken slightly if it sits around, so stir through a little more warm water if you need to‚Äîit should be the consistency of runny honey.
 Remove the cookies from the oven, leave them to cool for 5 minutes, then brush or dab the glaze all over with a pastry brush. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
 Once the dough is made, it can be covered in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for up to 2 days before baking.
 These will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container. The glaze will discolor and crack a little, but this will not affect how they taste."

In a medium bowl, stir the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until mixed. Cut in the shortening using a pastry blender or fork, until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the milk until mixture forms a soft dough and leaves the side of the bowl (dough will be soft and sticky).
 Lightly sprinkle flour over a cutting board or countertop. Place dough on floured surface; gently roll in the flour to coat. To knead dough, fold dough toward you. With the heels of your hands, lightly push dough away from you with a short rocking motion. Move dough a quarter turn and repeat 10 times. Dough will feel springy and smooth.
 On the floured surface, flatten dough evenly, using hands or a rolling pin, until dough is 1/2 inch thick.
 Before cutting each biscuit, dip a 2 1/2-inch round cutter into flour to lightly coat it so it will cut cleanly through the dough without sticking. To cut, push the cutter straight down through the dough without twisting or turning. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. On an ungreased cookie sheet, place biscuits about 1 inch apart for biscuits with crusty sides, or place with sides touching for biscuits with soft sides.
 Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.

 Bake until the sformati are set and the tops are browned, about 40 minutes. (If the water evaporates during baking, add more hot water.) Remove the ramekins from the casserole, and let sit until they are thoroughly cool. (Since they are served at room temperature, you can make the sformati well in advance.)
 When ready to serve, toss the salad greens with the lemon‚Äìolive oil dressing. Unmold the sformati by running a thin knife around the edge of the ramekins. Place a small plate on top of each ramekin, and invert it, tapping lightly if necessary. The sformati should come out of the mold in one piece. Peel and discard the parchment. Serve, browned side up, with the greens on the side."

1576,Souffl√©ed Cheesecake,"['1 3/4 cups (7 ounces) graham cracker crumbs (store-bought, or make Whole Wheat Graham Crackers)', '2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '2 pounds cream cheese (four 8-ounce packages), softened‚Äîabout 70¬∞F', '1 cup (8 ounces) fresh goat cheese (not precrumbled), softened‚Äîabout 70¬∞F', '1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1 tablespoon vanilla extract', '1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '1/4 teaspoon orange flower water', '2 cups (14 ounces) sugar', '6 large eggs, straight from the fridge', '3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream']","Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 450¬∞F. This recipe requires an 8-by-3 3/4-inch round pan, whether springform, non-latching with a removable bottom, or a traditional cake pan. With a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom in foil before attaching the sides. With a solid pan, line the bottom with parchment paper. In either case, lightly grease the pan.
 Add the crumbs, butter, and salt to the prepared pan, stir with a fork until well combined, and then compress into an even layer.
 Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until roughly combined, then increase to medium and beat until smooth, about 5 minutes; halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.
 Reduce speed to medium-low, add sugar all at once, and mix until well combined. Set a fine-mesh sieve over the bowl, crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through; discard any clots that remain. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.
 In a 1-quart stainless steel saucepan, bring the cream to a full boil. Add to batter while mixing on low; this helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing. Use immediately, or refrigerate until needed‚Äîup to 1 week (bring to room temperature before baking).
 Pour into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheesecake puffs 1/2 inch over the rim of the pan and is golden on top, about 20 minutes. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
 Turn off the oven and open the door to vent for 10 minutes. Close the door, set oven to 250¬∞F, and continue baking until the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm and the center registers 145¬∞F on a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes.
 Cool cheesecake for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Cool for an hour more, then cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 12 hours.
 Loosen the sides of the cheesecake with a thin knife. For a springform pan, simply pop the latch and remove the sides. For a non-latching pan, set on a large can of tomatoes or similarly sized object and use both hands to carefully drop the outer ring. For a solid cake pan, let stand in a few inches of scalding water until the pan feels warm. Drape the cake with plastic wrap and invert onto a large flat plate. Remove the pan or the bottom of a two-piece pan, peel off the parchment, and invert onto a serving plate.
 Cut with a long thin knife, pausing to clean the blade under hot running water between slices. Tightly wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep for up to 10 days in the fridge.

 Cookie Crumb Cheesecake: Replace the Graham Cracker crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs or Nutter Butter crumbs.
 Fromage: For a truly cheesy cake, reduce the cream cheese to 24 ounces, omit the goat cheese, and divide the remaining 16 ounces between two or more of your favorite soft, rich cheeses. Some of my favorites include Fromage d‚ÄôAffinois, Saint-Marcellin, B√ªcheron, mascarpone, and even Saint Agur (a particularly creamy blue). Their flavor will shine through clearly, so choose something you know and love.
 Green Tea Cheesecake: The herbal, mossy flavor of Japanese green tea provides a lovely counterpoint to the tangy richness of cream cheese. Simply whisk 2 tablespoons matcha (not bagged or loose green tea) into the sugar and proceed as directed.
 Pumpkin Cheesecake: Reduce cream cheese to 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups), replace lemon juice with ¬Ω ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rum, and increase kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Along with sugar, add 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1¬Ω teaspoons ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Omit heavy cream, and replace with 15 ounces (1 2/3 cups) pumpkin puree. If you like, serve with butterscotch sauce and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnut pieces.
 Gluten-Free: Prepare crust with the Gluten-Free variation of my Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers (TK LINK TO RECIPE); thanks to the roasted soybean flour in the dough, they bake up with a nutty richness much like classic whole wheat."

Mix on low speed to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until somewhat light, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add whole wheat flour, and mix to form a soft dough.
 Scrape dough onto a work surface and knead gently to form a ball. Divide in half. Use immediately or wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week; soften for 30 minutes at room temperature, then knead on a bare work surface until pliable and smooth.
 Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350¬∞F. Generously flour a large sheet of parchment and place one portion of dough in the center. Pat into a 5-by-6-inch rectangle, sprinkle with flour, flip, and dust again. Working from the center out and adding more flour as needed, roll the dough until roughly 15-by-11 inches and very thin. Slide onto an aluminum baking sheet and brush away excess flour. Repeat with remaining dough.
 For grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.
 Bake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes. Immediately cut along the pre-scored lines with a knife, or cut into free-form shapes using a pizza wheel. Cool to room temperature directly on the baking sheets. Enjoy scrap pieces as a snack, or pulverize into crumbs. The grahams can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks at room temperature or frozen for up to 3 months.
 Chocolate: My mom used to sandwich chocolate graham crackers with peanut butter for an after-school snack, a combo I re-create by reducing the whole wheat flour to 10 ounces (21/4 cups), sifted with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) natural or Dutch-process cocoa powder. To retain their deep cocoa color, roll the dough in sifted cocoa powder. Serve with generous smears of peanut butter and a tall glass of milk.
 Cinnamon Sugar: We rarely had sugar-coated grahams in our pantry when I was a kid, but they were always at my best friend‚Äôs house, and seemed all the more special for their rarity. For the dough, increase the cinnamon to ¬Ω teaspoon. Before docking, dust each sheet of dough with a half batch of Cinnamon Sugar (page 44), or any Sugar Sprinkle (page 46). Otherwise, dock and bake as directed. After the crackers cool, gently tap each against the baking sheet to knock off any excess sugar.
 Coconut (vegan): Replace the butter with 5 1/2 ounces (3/4 cup) virgin coconut oil (solid but creamy‚Äîabout 70¬∞F) and add 1 teaspoon pure coconut extract along with the vanilla.
 Gingerbread: This variation has all the spicy complexity of a Christmas cookie, with the unique flavor and crunch of a classic graham. Make the dough with sorghum or unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap) and increase the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Along with the sugar, add 1 tablespoon orange zest, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and a few cracks of black pepper.
 Graham Cracker Crumb Crust: Combine 9 ounces (2 cups) finely ground graham cracker crumbs with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter. Scatter into a 9-by-1 1/4-inch glass or ceramic pie plate and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides. Bake at 350¬∞F until firm, about 18 minutes. Cool to room temperature for immediate use in your favorite recipe, or wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for up to 1 week.

Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs appear, about 10 seconds. With the machine running, add vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water and process until the dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers and if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (2 tablespoons maximum). Do not over process.
 Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into two equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disc with smooth edges (no cracks), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour (or up to overnight).
 Preheat the oven to 425¬∞F with one rack on the bottom rung and one rack in the center of oven. Place a rimmed baking sheet on the bottom rack to preheat.
 On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 13-inch round. Roll the dough loosely around the rolling pin, and then unfurl it into the 9-inch pie pan. Gently lift and settle the dough into the pan. Trim the excess dough using scissors, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, and transfer to the refrigerator. On a floured piece of parchment, roll out the second disc of dough to the same size as the first and refrigerate both crusts for 30 minutes.
 In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk and set aside. Peel, core, and slice the apples into 1/4-inch thick wedges. Place apples in a large bowl and mix with 1/4 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and lemon. Fill the dough-lined pan with the apple mixture, packing apple slices as tightly as possible.
 Brush the rim with egg and milk mixture, reserving the excess. Top with the second dough round and press over apples to minimize excess space between apples and crust. Press the top and bottom crusts together and trim the top crust to a 1-inch edge around pan. Tuck top edge under bottom edge and crimp or decorate as desired. Cut five vents in the top crust for steam. Refrigerate pie for 30 minutes to set the crimp.
 Brush top crust with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
 Place pie on the preheated rimmed baking sheet and bake until the crust begins to turn golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Rotate sheet, move to center rack, and reduce oven to 350¬∞F. Continue baking until the crust is golden brown and you can see the thickened juices bubbling, 40 to 50 minutes more. Cool on a rack 3 to 4 hours to allow juices to set before slicing.
 The pie dough can be made up to 3 days in advance and chilled, or frozen for up to 3 months; thaw before using. The baked pie will keep, loosely covered with aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 2 days."

 Set blade on a box cutter to about 1/3"" (or use a very sharp paring knife or X-Acto knife) and cut long parallel lines into the skin of pork shoulder, spacing about 3/4"" apart. You want to cut completely through the fat, getting as close to the meat as possible without slicing into it. Then, using a pair of kitchen shears, snip between rows to create a diamond-shape pattern, spacing about 3/4"" apart. Cutting a crosshatch design into the fat will help it cook out and allow the salt and spices to penetrate the meat.
 Rub entire shoulder with spice mixture, covering any exposed meat and pushing into cuts in fat. Try to get the spices into the fatty layer and not on the surface of the skin, where they may burn as the shoulder roasts. Make sure to use all of the spices, even though it may seem like a lot.

Cook remaining 5 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until butter foams, then turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in garlic; scrape butter mixture and all those toasty milk solids at the bottom of the pan into bowl with butter pieces. Reserve saucepan. Stir until all the butter is melted and mixture is smooth. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until butter is room temperature and solidified, 15‚Äì20 minutes.
 Meanwhile, whisk 1/4 cup milk, 3 Tbsp. flour, and 1/4 cup water in reserved saucepan until smooth, then set over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until it becomes a very stiff paste resembling mashed potatoes, about 2 minutes. Scrape into the bowl of a stand mixer; reserve saucepan.
 Gently heat remaining 1/2 cup milk in reserved saucepan over low (it should be warm to the touch but not steaming hot). Remove from heat and let sit 1 minute. Add yeast and whisk until dissolved. Let mixture sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.
 Meanwhile, brush bottom and sides of a 13x9"" baking dish with 2 Tbsp. garlic butter; set aside. Set aside another 2 Tbsp. garlic butter in a small bowl for brushing over baked rolls.
 Add yeast mixture, sugar, 1 egg, and remaining 2 1/4 cups flour to paste in mixer bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms. Add kosher salt, increase speed to medium, and continue mixing until dough forms a smooth single mass, about 3 minutes. Reduce speed to low again and add remaining garlic butter a tablespoonful at a time, waiting until incorporated before adding more. Once all of the garlic butter has been added, increase mixer speed back to medium and mix dough until very soft, smooth, and supple, another 8‚Äì10 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl; form dough into a ball and place in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft-free spot until doubled in size, 45‚Äì60 minutes.
 Punch down dough and knead several times to deflate, then turn out onto a clean work surface. To form the rolls, divide dough into 15 equal pieces (about 1 1/2 oz. each). Working one at a time and keeping other pieces covered in plastic, fold edges of dough underneath, pinching bottom to seal. Turn 90¬∞ and fold and pinch again. Repeat process until you have created a smooth sphere with no seams except at the bottom.
 Place ball on work surface and rest the side of your hand next to it so your palm and fingers are cupped around it. Drag the ball toward you, using friction against the work surface to create tension and stretch the surface of the dough into a smooth, taut dome. This shaping method tightens the gluten over the surface so the rolls rise evenly upward and outward instead of slumping into amorphous blobs. Repeat with remaining balls of dough and place in prepared pan in a 5x3 grid, spacing evenly apart.
 Loosely cover pan with plastic wrap and let rolls rise in a warm draft-free spot until doubled in size and touching, 35‚Äì45 minutes (to test, poke one with an oiled finger; dough should spring back but leave a slight indentation).

 Put the pretzels into a resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin into pieces that are no larger than 1/4 in/6 mm. (Or pulse the pretzels in a food processor, if you prefer.) Pour the crushed pretzels and their crumbs into a medium bowl and stir in the butter and brown sugar. Press the crust mixture into the bottom of a 9-in/23-cm springform pan, covering the bottom of the pan evenly. Bake the crust until it is lightly toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. It will be soft and puffy when you first remove it from the oven, but will harden as it cools. Set the crust aside to cool completely.
 Put the bowl of a stand mixer and the whip attachment in the freezer for 10 minutes.
 Attach the bowl and the whisk attachment to the mixer, and pour in the cream. Begin whipping the cream on medium speed. When it starts to thicken, pour in 2 tbsp of the granulated sugar and the vanilla. Whip the cream mixture on medium speed until soft peaks form. (When you dip a spoon into the whipped cream and pull it out, the cream should form a peak that curls back onto itself.) Set aside 1 1/2 cups/360 ml of the whipped cream in a small bowl. Transfer the remaining whipped cream to a separate bowl, cover, and refrigerate; you will use it to top the tart later.
 Put the remaining 1/2 cup/100 g of granulated sugar and the cream cheese in the bowl of the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat the sugar and cream cheese together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer, and stir the reserved 1 1/2 cups of whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until it is homogenous. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cooled crust. Be sure to completely cover the crust, spreading the filling to the edges of the pan. Use a damp paper towel to wipe down any specks of filling clinging to the sides of the pan or the edges of the tart will appear messy when the springform is removed. Refrigerate until chilled and set, 30 minutes.
 Meanwhile, bring 1/2 cup/120 ml of the water to a boil over high heat. Put the gelatin powder in a medium heat-proof bowl and pour in the boiling water. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup/60 ml of cold water. Allow the gelatin to cool to room temperature.
 While the gelatin cools, arrange the strawberries, cut-side down, over the cream cheese filling to cover the entire top of the tart. Start by lining the edge of the tart with a ring of strawberries and work your way to the center in a target pattern. The tips of the berries should be pointing straight up. Pour the gelatin over the strawberries and cream cheese layer, coating the tops of the strawberries in the gelatin as you pour. Refrigerate, covered, until the gelatin is completely set, at least 1 hour. (The tart can be refrigerated up to 1 day before serving.)
 Remove the sides of the pan and transfer the tart (still on the springform base) to a serving platter. Gently rewhisk the reserved whipped cream for 10 to 15 seconds and pile it in the center of the tart, if you wish or pass at the table. Slice and serve immediately."

Add 1/2 cup warm water (100-115¬∞F) to the bowl of a stand mixer or another large bowl. Sprinkle yeast over. Add brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Let yeast bloom until foamy, 5-7 minutes.
 Stir in bread flour, beer, sea salt, and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Continue to stir until a shaggy mass forms. Mix with dough hook on medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth ball, about 2 minutes. Dough should be firm and might be a little tacky, but not sticky. If dough is still sticky, add flour, 1 Tbsp. at a time, mixing until smooth. If dough is too dry, add warm water 1 tsp. at a time. Continue to mix on medium-low speed until dough is elastic, 5-7 minutes. (Alternatively, turn out dough onto an unfloured work surface and knead by hand.)
 Transfer dough to prepared bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
 Meanwhile, preheat oven to 275¬∞F. Line a small rimmed baking sheet or pie pan with foil. Sprinkle baking soda, if using, onto sheet and bake 1 hour. Let cool.

If bottom starts to brown, reduce heat to medium-low and add water, 1 Tbsp. at a time. Let cool to room temperature.
 Preheat oven to 450¬∞F. Butter a 10"" cast-iron skillet. Punch down dough on an unfloured surface to deflate, then divide in half (an easy way to do this is to use a scale and divide by weight). Return one half to greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap while you work on the other piece.
 Using a rolling pin, roll dough to a 13"" circle. Settle into prepared skillet and let dough relax into pan, just coming up and over the edge slightly. If it shrinks, stretch it by hand to create an even rim. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20‚Äì30 minutes.
 Divide second piece of dough into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces on a rimmed baking sheet covered with plastic, roll on an unfloured surface to form 1 (36""-long) rope. Arrange rope in a U-shape with ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross ends, then fold them down toward you to create a pretzel shape about 11"" wide. Return to rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Roll remaining 2 pieces to form 2 more (36""-long) ropes. Twist ropes tightly around each other to make a twisted rope about 35"" long. Add to baking sheet with pretzel shape and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20‚Äì30 minutes.
 If dough has settled into skillet, stretch dough to come back up just to outside rim. Using a fork, evenly prick bottom of dough in pan. Brush dough all over with baking soda mixture, if using. Beat egg yolk with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, then brush dough with egg wash. Cover only outer rim of dough with foil. Bake dough in skillet until light golden brown and dry, 12‚Äì15 minutes. Let cool slightly, at least 5 minutes.
 Brush just outside rim of crust with egg wash and attach twisted dough rope to create a decorative rim. Fill crust with apple mixture. Center pretzel shape over apple filling, stretching dough until edges of pretzel reach twisted outside rim. Brush twisted dough rope and top of pretzel shape with baking soda mixture, if using, then egg wash. Sprinkle with pretzel salt.
 Bake pie until pretzel is golden brown and firm to the touch, 12‚Äì15 minutes. If underside of dough seems underbaked, loosely cover top with foil and continue to bake, checking every 2 minutes, until cooked through. Let cool completely before slicing, at least 2 hours.
 Pretzel dough can be made 1 day ahead. Let come to room temperature, then let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Apple pie filling can be made 2 days ahead.

1685,Traditional Soft Pretzels,"['1 (1/4-oz/7-g) package active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)', '1/2 cup/120 ml warm water (between 100 and 115¬∞F/38 and 45¬∞C)', '1 tbsp barley malt syrup or 1 tbsp firmly packed dark brown sugar', '3 1/4 cups/420 g unbleached bread flour', '1/2 cup/120 ml cold pilsner-style beer', '2 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the bowl', '2 tsp fine sea salt, such as fleur de sel or sel gris', '2 tbsp food-grade lye', 'or 1/4 cup/60 g baked baking soda (see separate notes)']","Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl. Add the barley malt syrup, stirring until it is dissolved. Allow the yeast to bloom until it is foamy, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the flour, beer, butter, and salt and continue stirring to form a shaggy mass. Attach the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and begin kneading on medium-low speed. After about 1 minute the dough will form a smooth ball. The dough should be quite firm and may be slightly tacky, but not sticky. (If it is sticky, add a little more flour, about 1 tbsp at a time, and knead it in until the dough is smooth. If the dough is too dry to come together, add more water, 1 tsp at a time.) Continue kneading the dough on medium-low speed until it is elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, turn the shaggy dough out onto an unfloured work surface and knead it by hand.
 Choose a bowl that will be large enough to contain the dough after it has doubled in size, and grease it lightly with butter. Transfer the dough to the greased bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Put the dough in the refrigerator to rise for at least 8 hours, and up to 24 hours, for optimal flavor.
 For quick pretzels, allow the dough to rise at room temperature (in a warm spot) until it has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
 Line two 12-by-17-in/30.5-by-43-cm rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
 Turn the dough out onto an unfloured work surface and firmly press it down to deflate. To form the classic pretzel shape, cut the dough into eight equal portions. Work with one piece of dough at a time and keep the rest covered with a damp, clean kitchen towel. Pat a piece of dough down with your fingertips to form a rough rectangle about 3 1/2 by 5 1/2 in/9 by 14 cm. Beginning on a long side, roll the dough up tightly, forming it into a little loaf. Pinch the seam together. Shape the dough into a rope by rolling it against the work surface with your palms and applying mild pressure, working from the center of the dough out to the ends. If you need more friction, spray the counter with a little water from a squirt bottle or drizzle a few drops of water and spread it with your hand. Once you can feel that the dough rope doesn‚Äôt want to stretch any farther (usually when it is between 12 to 16 in/30.5 to 40.5 cm long), set it aside to rest and begin shaping another piece in the same manner. Repeat this process with the remaining pieces of dough.
 Return to the first dough rope and continue rolling it out to a length of 24 to 28 in/61 to 71 cm, leaving the center about 1 in/2.5 cm in diameter and tapering the ends thinly by applying a little more pressure as you work your way out. Position the dough rope into a U shape, with the ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross the ends about 3 in/7.5 cm from the tips and then cross them again. Fold the ends down and press them into the U at about 4 and 8 o‚Äôclock, allowing about 1/4 in/6 mm of the ends to overhang. Place the pretzel on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a damp towel. Repeat this process with the remaining dough, spacing out the pretzels on the baking sheets at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart and covering them with a damp towel.
 Allow the covered pretzels to rise at warm room temperature until they have increased in size by about half, 20 to 30 minutes. (The pretzels can be refrigerated at this point, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 8 hours before dipping and baking them.)
 At least 20 minutes before baking, position one rack in the upper third and another rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 500¬∞F/260¬∞C/gas 10.
 Prepare the lye solution or baked baking soda solution.
 Use a large skimmer to gently dip the pretzels in the lye or baked baking soda solution, one or two at a time. Leave them in the solution for about 20 seconds, carefully turning once after 10 seconds. Remove the pretzels from the liquid, drain, and return them to the baking sheets, spacing them at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart. If the ends come detached, simply reposition them. Repeat with the remaining pretzels.
 Use a sharp paring knife or razor blade to cut a slit about 1/4 in/6 mm deep in the thickest part of each pretzel (the bottom of the U). Top them as you choose, if desired. Bake the pretzels until they are deep mahogany in color, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom halfway through the baking time. Transfer the pretzels to a rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving. The pretzels are best enjoyed the day they are made, ideally warm from the oven or within an hour of being baked.
 To store the pretzels, allow them to cool completely and then wrap each one individually in plastic wrap. Store them at room temperature for up to 2 days, or put the plastic-wrapped pretzels in a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze them for up to 1 month. Reheat the pretzels in a 350¬∞F/180¬∞C/gas 4 oven for about 5 minutes, or for 10 to 12 minutes if frozen."

Melt the coconut oil, then add the onion, cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, stir in the rice and cook for an additional 2 minutes. This toasts the rice and gives it a wonderful nutty flavor. Pour in the white wine and allow it to reduce by half before adding 12 ounces of stock. Stir often and allow the rice to absorb most of the liquid before adding more. Continue cooking the rice, adding the liquid in 4-ounce increments and remembering to stir often.
 When the rice feels just about fully cooked add the asparagus and continue to cook. At this point the rice should be thick and creamy. Add the peas, stir to combine, and heat through. Season with the salts, black pepper, and stir in the mint and coconut butter. Serve immediately."
1687,Make-Ahead Whipped Cream,"['1/2 cup (4 ounces) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) heavy cream', '2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean', 'split lengthwise with a paring knife']","Combine sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla extract, if using, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. If using a vanilla bean, run the flat of the blade down each half to scrape out the seeds and add them to the cream (reserve the pod for another project). Mix on medium-low speed to dissolve the sugar, about a minute, then increase to medium-high and whip until cream is thick enough to hold firm peaks, about 3 minutes.
 Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate until needed, up to 8 hours.
 Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week; before serving, briefly rewhip the cream to restore its light and silky texture.
 Basil: This emerald-green variation has an herbal freshness that's perfect with strawberry shortcake. Grind the sugar with 2 ounces (2 cups loosely packed) fresh basil leaves in a food processor until the leaves disappear and the sugar looks wet, like pesto. Proceed as directed.
 Cherry Pit: A light cherry-almond flavor thats perfect with a slice of cherry pie. Combine heavy cream with 3 3/4 ounces (1/3 cup) cherry pits, cover, and steep overnight in the fridge. Strain and whip as directed.
 Cocoa: Combine the sugar with 1 ounce (1/3 cup) Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Cacao Barry Extra Brute.
 Freeze-Dried Fruit: This variation is as colorful as it is tasty. Grind sugar with 1/3 ounce (1/3 cup) freeze-dried fruit such as bananas, blueberries, cherries, or cranberries in a food processor until powdery and fine, then whip as directed. For a thicker consistency, pulse in the food processor bowl until thick, just 90 seconds or so.
 Orange: Combine sugar with 1 tablespoon orange zest and 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water.
 Strawberry: Double strawberry shortcake, anyone? Add 2 ounces (1/4 cup) chilled strawberry syrup to the cream and proceed as directed."
1688,Quick Condensed Milk,"['4 cups (32 ounces) milk (any percentage will do)', '3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream', '1 cup (7 ounces) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)']","Combine milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it‚Äôs almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scale, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started.
 Pour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to 1 month. To mimic the consistency of canned milk, bring to room temperature before using.
 Even slightly acidic ingredients will cause hot dairy to curdle, including raw cane sugar, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, honey, and agave. Take care when experimenting with ingredients not listed in the variations.
 Chai Spice: Along with the sugar, add two 4-inch cinnamon sticks, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries, 10 whole black peppercorns, 5 whole cloves, and 6 white cardamom pods, gently cracked. Proceed as directed. For an easy chai latte, stir 1 tablespoon of the spiced milk into 6 ounces (3/4 cup) hot black tea, such as Assam.
 Dulce de Leche: This rich and nutty variation owes its caramel flavor and color to baking soda, which raises the dairy‚Äôs pH, allowing the lactose to brown at lower temperatures than normal. Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the sugar and proceed as directed; though the mixture will foam more vigorously, there is no risk of overflow. Made with goat‚Äôs milk in the variation below, dulce de leche is known as cajeta. As the browning process will resume with continued exposure to heat, neither dulce de leche or cajeta can be used as an ingredient in baked goods.
 Fresh Ginger: Peel and roughly chop a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger; add along with the sugar.
 Goat's-Milk: This variation is more easily digested by those with lactose intolerance, and because goat‚Äôs milk won‚Äôt curdle when it‚Äôs boiled, there‚Äôs no need for cream. Trust me, there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äúgoaty‚Äù about it‚Äîjust gentle creaminess anyone can enjoy. Replace milk and cream with 38 ounces (4 3/4 cups) goat‚Äôs milk and proceed as directed. Note: This variation requires ‚Äúultra-high temperature‚Äù pasteurized goat‚Äôs milk, as raw or low-heat pasteurized versions may turn grainy with prolonged cooking.
 Lavender: During the cooking process, lavender mellows into something soft and aromatic, without any hint of the soapiness that can so often be its downfall. Add 1 tablespoon dried lavender buds along with the sugar.
 Rosemary: Wonderfully herbaceous, this variation is my absolute favorite way to make Pumpkin Pie. Add a 4-inch sprig of fresh rosemary along with the sugar.
 Soft-Serve: This eggless ice cream has an unbelievably pure and creamy flavor, with a silkiness that reminds me of Dairy Queen soft serve. Prepare the Quick Condensed Milk or any variation and pour into a large bowl. Add 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream, 2 ounces (1/4 cup) whole milk, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (half as much if iodized), and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract and mix well. Chill until cold, about 2 hours, and churn according to manufacturer directions.
 Vanilla Bean: I make this variation whenever I have an empty vanilla bean left over from another project, as the cooking process will extract considerable flavor from even the most withered pod (the sheer volume of seeds in a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù pod can turn the milk gray). Add scraped vanilla pod to the milk and proceed as directed. To deepen the flavor, leave the vanilla pod in the jar of Quick Condensed Milk."
1689,No-Stress All-Butter Pastry Crust,"['1 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon | 8 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal, plus more for dusting', '1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) sugar', '1 1/2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)', '2 sticks (8 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes', '1/2 cup (4 ounces) cold water']","Sift flour into a medium bowl (if using cup measures, spoon into the cups and level with a knife before sifting). Whisk in sugar and salt. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes, no smaller, and toss with flour to break up the pieces. Roughly smash each cube flat‚Äînothing more! Stir in cold water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball. With a dough temperature at or below 70¬∞F, it will feel dry to the touch.
 Transfer to a generously floured work space, sprinkle with more flour, and roll into a 10-by-15-inch sheet. Fold each 10-inch side toward the middle, and close the packet like a book. Fold top to bottom to make a thick block, then cut in half. Using as much flour as needed, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Brush off excess flour, drape over a 9-inch tempered glass pie plate, making sure it‚Äôs flush against the pan.
 Trim excess dough into a 1 1/4-inch overhang all around, then fold over to create a 3/4-inch border that sits on the rim of the plate; if positioned inside the rim, the crust will be too shallow to accommodate the filling. Pinch or press the border into a zigzag pattern, and repeat with remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or overnight. Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.
 Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350¬∞F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim. Fill with plain white sugar, a delicious alternative to options like rice or beans.
 Bake on an aluminum baking sheet until fully set and golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and carefully lift out the foil, setting it aside until the sugar has cooled. If the sides of the crust seem puffy or pale, continue baking 10 minutes more. Cool to room temperature. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
 If the temperature climbs above 73¬∞F in your kitchen, be aware that everything from your countertop to your rolling pin and the flour itself will act as a heat source to the butter. Combat these conditions by refrigerating your pie plate, rolling pin, and dry ingredients until cool‚Äînot cold or frozen. If needed, chill the countertops of a sweltering hot kitchen with bags of ice water.
 Gluten-Free: Replace the all-purpose flour with 4 ounces (3/4 cup) white rice flour, 2 1/2 ounces (1/2 cup) cornstarch, 1 1/2 ounces (1/3 cup) tapioca flour, 1 ounce (1/4 cup) coconut flour, and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum. Prepare the dough as directed, using a generous amount of cornstarch for dusting. The dough will crack along the creases as it‚Äôs folded, but that‚Äôs all right. After portioning the dough, roll to just 12 inches. Cut into quarters and transfer to the pie plate one at a time, pressing the pieces together and then sculpting the border like clay. Chill and bake as directed."

Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of turkey, or 2/3 tsp. Morton kosher salt per pound of turkey. For example, for a 12-pound turkey, use 1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Morton kosher salt.
 Whisk salt, mustard powder, paprika, thyme, pepper, garlic powder, brown sugar, and onion powder in a small bowl.
 Place turkey, breast side down, on a large cutting board. Cut along each side of backbone with kitchen shears‚Äîthis will take some force (you can ask your butcher to do this). Discard backbone or reserve for another use (like stock for gravy).
 With turkey skin side down, use a knife to score long oblong bone in center of breast all the way down. Turn turkey skin side up, then firmly press down with both hands on breastbone until you hear a cracking sound. The bone should be cracked completely in half; if not, use your knife to cut the bone the rest of the way in half.
 Pat turkey very dry with paper towels. Rub spice mixture all over skin and flesh sides. Splay open, skin side up, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Tuck wing tips under breasts. Chill, uncovered, at least 1 day, preferably 2, and up to 3. If you‚Äôd rather cover the bird, loosely cover with plastic wrap, then uncover for the final 4‚Äì6 hours of chilling. Do not rinse turkey after brining. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour before cooking.
 Prepare a grill for medium heat (if your grill has a thermometer, it should register about 350¬∞F). Wrap bricks or cinder block in foil.
 Oil grates well and transfer turkey, skin side down, onto grill. Wearing heatproof gloves, arrange bricks on top of turkey, with 3 across breast and 1 across drumsticks, or place cinder block in the center. Cover grill and cook, checking every 5 minutes, until skin side is deep golden brown and crispy, 10‚Äì15 minutes total.
 Wearing heatproof gloves, carefully remove bricks or cinder block and flip bird over, skin side up. Cover grill and continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 160¬∞F (take temperature in a few places including thickest part of thigh and breast), 65‚Äì80 minutes more, replenishing coals if needed. Transfer turkey to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving.
 Turkey can be seasoned with dry brine ideally 2 days but up to 3 days ahead. Keep chilled."

 Pulse 3/4 cup fruit and 1/2 cup hot water in a food processor until smooth and incorporated, 3‚Äì4 minutes. Add honey, almond butter, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla and pulse until combined, about 15 seconds. Add 1/2 cup oats and pulse until well combined, 30‚Äì45 seconds. Add pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, coconut, and remaining 1 cup oats and 1/2 cup fruit. Pulse until just combined, about 15 seconds.
 Transfer mixture to prepared pan, pressing down until completely even. Bake granola until darkened, firm around the edges, and the center gives just slightly when pressed, about 35 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool in pan. Remove granola using parchment overhang, then cut into 20 bars with a serrated knife.
 Granola can be made 5 days ahead. Keep tightly wrapped at room temperature."
1713,French Buttercream,"['1 cup water', '2 cups sugar', '2 tablespoons corn syrup', '1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar', '5 egg yolks', '1 whole egg', '1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum', '1 1/2 pounds cold butter', 'preferably European']","In a heavy nonreactive saucepan, add water, then add sugar, corn syrup, and cream of tartar. The last 2 help keep the sugar from crystallizing. (Candy thermometer. Non-negotiable!)
 Put the pot on high heat. It's going to be there for a while. Be patient and keep your eye on it. Don't go walking away and watching TV or something.
 Put yolks and eggs in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and turn to high. Just let it go! Eggs will triple in volume and go to ""ribbons stage."" You can't overwhip!
 Wait on the sugar‚Äîlooking for 230¬∞F, aka ""soft ball."" When it happens, be ready to move quickly. Turn off the mixer and add the xanthan gum, turn back up to medium.
 Remove the thermometer from hot sugar. Lift with two hands. Rest the lip of the saucepan on the edge of the mixer bowl.
 Slowly tilt and pour sugar in a sloooow steady stream down the side of the bowl. Don't go too fast! If you do there will be chunks of scrambled eggs in your buttercream.
 Once sugar is all in, turn the mixer to high. Beat until cool. Gauge this by putting the inside of your wrist to the outside of the bowl. It's more accurate than your hands. Switch out the whisk for the paddle. Next we're adding the butter. It's too heavy for the whisk and you'll end up breaking your stand mixer if you stay with the whisk.
 Start cutting the butter into thin pieces‚Äîyou could shave it with a cheese slicer if you'd like. Add butter piece by piece‚Äîpain in the derriere, yes, but we're making an emulsion.
 See, if you dump all the butter in at once, the butter and eggs will never combine properly, and you'll have a ""broken"" buttercream. You'll be able to identify this easily‚Äîit'll be a chunky, watery, hot mess.
 If your buttercream does break, you can fix it! Turn to medium high, then add a little more butter, piece by piece, until fixed. Or try adding a little guar gum! This is very strong, so add a pinch and beat for a minute, then check.
 Once your butter is added, turn the mixer to medium high to add some air‚Äî10, 20 seconds at most. Quelle Magnifique! It should be fluffy and make you want to eat it with your fingers.
 Once you have your base, there's so many ways to flavor it! Coffee powder! Vanilla beans! Dutch cocoa! Peanut butter! Caramel! Ham! Ok, maybe not ham. Party pooper.
 Congratulations! You did it! You made French buttercream! You are a god amongst men!

1714,Detroit-Style Pizza,"['1 cup (230g) Water, 100¬∞F [38¬∞C]', '1 tsp sea salt', '2 cups plus 1 Tbsp (290g) all-purpose flour', '3/4 tsp instant yeast', '1 (28-oz/795g) can crushed tomatoes', '3 Tbsp (44g) granulated sugar', '1 tsp dried oregano, crushed', '1 Tbsp dried basil, crushed', '1 1/2 tsp finely minced garlic', '1 tsp sea salt', '1/2 tsp ground black pepper', '1/4 cup (45g) shredded Parmesan cheese', '8 slices pepperoni (optional)', '2 cups (230g) shredded mozzarella cheese', '2 cups (230g) shredded brick cheese (or mozzarella)', '1 pinch dried oregano', '1 pinch sea salt', '1 cup (230g) pizza sauce', 'warm']","In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the water and sea salt and stir to dissolve the salt. Add the flour and yeast and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough becomes a shaggy mass. Make sure that all of the flour is hydrated. Using the dough hook attachment, mix on medium-low speed for 4 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl and release the dough from the hook. Mix for an additional 4 minutes. It will now hold a round shape.
 Spray a bowl with nonstick cooking spray or brush lightly with olive oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic. Let the dough relax for 15 minutes, and then shape the dough.
 Lightly oil or butter the inside surfaces of a 9-by-13-in [23-by-33-cm] baking pan or Detroit pizza pan.
 Place the dough into the pan and use your fingertips to spread the dough out to the corners and sides of the pan. The dough will be sticky, so lightly dip your fingertips in oil to make stretching it easier. Set the pan aside, cover with plastic, and let rise in a warm area for1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 in [1.5 to 2 cm] tall in the pan.
 Combine the tomatoes, sugar, oregano, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir together in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring periodically. Using an immersion blender or food processor, pur√©e the sauce until smooth. Place it back over medium heat. Simmer the pur√©ed sauce until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes, stirring periodically.
 Keep the sauce warm for ladling over the pizza, or cool and refrigerate for up to a week. This recipe makes about 3 cups [710 ml] of sauce and it can also be frozen for up to 3 months, if desired. You will have more sauce than you need for one pizza.
 Preheat the oven to 475¬∞F [240¬∞C].
 Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese around the edge of the pizza where the dough touches the sides of the pan. This cheese will form a crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. If desired, place pepperoni in two rows of four down the length of the pizza, directly on top of the dough. Gently push the pepperoni into the dough.
 Sprinkle the mozzarella and brick cheeses over the surface of the pizza, spreading them all the way to the edges where the dough meets the sides of the pan. This cheese will also contribute to the crispy, caramelized edge on the crust. Season the top of the pizza with a pinch each of oregano and salt.
 Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Look for an amber-colored top and crispy edges.
 After removing the pizza from the oven, use a small offset spatula or knife to loosen the sides of the crust from the pan. Slide the pizza out of the pan onto a cooling rack. At this point, if a crispier bottom is desired, you can put the pizza (out of the pan) directly onto the oven rack or a sheet tray and bake for an extra 5 minutes for a slightly more browned finish on the bottom of the crust.
 After you remove the pizza from the oven, top it with the warm sauce. Traditionally, it is ladled into two rows down the length of the pizza. Serve warm.
 This pizza can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated on a lightly oiled sheet tray at 475¬∞F [240¬∞C]."
1715,Peter Luger-Style Steak Sauce,"['1 cup ketchup', '2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce', '2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar', '2 tablespoons mild-flavored molasses', '2 tablespoons prepared horseradish', '1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar', '1/2 teaspoon garlic powder', '1/4 teaspoon kosher salt', '1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1/4 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce', 'such as Tabasco']","Whisk ketchup, Worcestershire, vinegar, molasses, horseradish, sugar, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and hot sauce in a medium bowl.

1716,Thanksgiving Sangria,"['3 cups pomegranate juice', '5 (3"") cinnamon sticks', '1/2 teaspoon whole allspice', '1 (4"") piece peeled fresh ginger, thinly sliced (about 3/4 cup), divided', '1 (750-ml) bottle red wine', '1 Bartlett pear, quartered lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise', '1/2 cup pomegranate seeds', '1/2 cup spiced rum', '1 (750-ml) bottle pear or apple sparkling cider']","Bring pomegranate juice, cinnamon, allspice, and one-third of ginger to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook 10 minutes, then remove from heat and let steep 10 minutes.
 Strain pomegranate mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, reserving cinnamon sticks. Add wine, pear, pomegranate seeds, rum, cinnamon sticks, and remaining ginger and stir to combine. Cover and chill at least 4 hours.
 To serve, fill pitcher or punch bowl with ice and pour sangria over. Top with cider.
 Sangria, without ice or cider, can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill."
1717,Apple Brioche Tart,"['623 g (5 cups plus 3 tablespoons) bread flour', '99 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar', '12 g (1 tablespoon) fine sea salt', '10 g (1 tablespoon) instant yeast', '283 g (5 large) cold eggs, lightly whisked', '242 g (1 cup) whole milk', '397 g (14 oz) unsalted butter, at room temperature', '28 g (1 oz / 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1 recipe Brioche Dough, cold', '1.13 kg (about 6 medium) Honeycrisp apples (or another good baking apple)', '106 g (1/2 cup packed) light brown sugar', '2 g (1 teaspoon) ground cinnamon', 'Flaky sea salt', 'for sprinkling']","In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, granulated sugar, and salt on low speed to combine. Add the yeast and mix to combine, 10 to 15 seconds more. Add the eggs and milk and mix for 4 minutes. The dough should form a sticky, shaggy ball around the hook.
 Increase the speed to medium and slowly add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, being careful to incorporate each addition before adding the next; the entire process should take about 3 minutes. (If you add the butter too quickly, it can create a greasy disaster in the bowl, so pace it out.) Scrape the bowl down once or twice to make sure everything is homogeneous. (This mixing period is called intense mixing‚Äîand it is! Don‚Äôt be alarmed if the mixing is noisy or difficult in the early to mid-stages, it will come together.) Then knead the dough until it is smooth and uniform, 1 minute more.
 Grease a large bowl with nonstick spray. Transfer the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.
 Use the butter to generously grease an 18-by-13-inch baking sheet, including the rim.
 On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle a little larger than the pan (about 1 inch on all sides), so that the dough will come up the sides of the pan.
 Roll up the dough around the rolling pin and transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Use a pastry wheel to trim the edges so they are flush with the edges of the pan. Cover the baking sheet with greased plastic wrap (I use nonstick spray) and let the dough rise in a warm place for 30 to 35 minutes.
 Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F / 175¬∞C, with a rack in the middle.
 Meanwhile, peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice crosswise 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick (see Pro Tip).
 In a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Uncover the dough and sprinkle it evenly with half the cinnamon sugar. Arrange the apple slices across the dough (see Pro Tip). Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon sugar evenly over the apples. Finish with the salt.
 Bake the tart until the edges of the crust are golden brown, the apples are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, and the sugar has caramelized, 32 to 36 minutes. Cool the tart for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving, warm or at room temperature.
 This tart is best the same day it's made. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days."
1718,Papa John‚Äôs Style Garlic Butter Sauce,"['1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cubed', '2 teaspoons garlic powder', '3/4 teaspoon kosher salt']","Bring 1 Tbsp. water to a boil in a small saucepan, then reduce to a simmer.

Roll out puff pastry on a sheet of lightly floured parchment paper, smoothing out creases, to a large rectangle measuring about 15x10"". Prick pastry in a few places with a fork, leaving a 1"" border around the edges, then slide parchment paper onto a rimmed baking sheet.
 Combine garlic and 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl and brush dough with garlic oil, staying within border. Arrange lemon slices in a single layer over brushed pastry, then scatter basil over lemon slices.
 Arrange tomatoes on top (a little overlap is okay). Sprinkle with lots of salt and a few grinds of pepper, then drizzle with 1 Tbsp. oil.
 Bake tart until edges of pastry are browned, puffed, and crisp, 30‚Äì35 minutes. Let tart cool 10 minutes before cutting into 8 pieces. Drizzle with more oil and top each with a dollop of cr√®me fra√Æche."

 Arrange potatoes, cut side down, on a large rimmed baking sheet, spacing evenly. Pour in 1 1/2 to 2 cups water‚Äîenough to cover the surface in a thin layer but not so much that it spills the second you move the sheet.
 Cover baking sheet with a double layer of foil, crimping sides very tightly to seal well. This will trap in steam and prevent water from sloshing out if you accidentally jostle the sheet.
 Bake until a fork or a skewer slides easily through the potatoes, 25 to 30 minutes. The foil will be puffed; pierce it with the fork or skewer and poke around for a couple of potatoes to test.
 Let potatos cool, still covered, 5 minutes. Use tongs to peel back foil about 1 inch at on corner. Carefully tip sheet and pour off water (its job is done). Crank up oven to 500¬∞F or as high as it goes.

1789,Caramelized Onions,"['2 large yellow onions, peeled (about 1 pound)', '2 tablespoons unsalted butter', 'Kosher salt', 'Low-sodium chicken broth or water (for pan; optional)']","Halve both onions through root end. Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).
 Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end). You‚Äôre going for slices that are 1/4""‚Äì1/8"" thick.
 Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves. It‚Äôs a lot of onion! But it will cook down quite a bit, so it‚Äôs best to start with a large quantity.
 Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling. You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove. Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.
 Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1‚Äì2 minutes. Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you‚Äôve added all the onions. Season with a pinch of salt.
 Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15‚Äì20 minutes. This is the point of doneness for French onion soup! If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they‚Äôre sticking, reduce your heat a bit.
 If you‚Äôre going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15‚Äì20 minutes. Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn. If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water. The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.
 For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10‚Äì15 minutes. This requires constant attention so they don‚Äôt burn. No one said caramelized onions were quick!
 Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill. They will keep up to 1 week."

Line several cookie sheets with wax paper. Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls. Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute.

 In a medium bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the tahini, 3/4 cup water, salt, and the ice cube. Whisk vigorously until the mixture comes together. It should lighten in color and thicken enough that it holds an edge when the whisk is dragged through it.
 Remove the ice cube if any remains unmelted and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice and salt until the sauce is addictive‚Äîyou will know. Scrape the sauce into a shallow serving dish and hide it from the eaters in your house until ready to serve.
 Layer a plate with the roasted fruit, then drizzle with the tahini dressing. Sprinkle with the reserved fresh thyme or oregano and a pinch of flaky sea salt."
1816,Fresh Garden Wrap,"['1 cup cherry tomatoes, cut in half', '1 cup shredded kale or bok choy', '1 zucchini, chopped', '1 cup broccoli florets', '1/2 cup chopped green onions', '1 (15-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed', '1 tablespoon chopped Kalamata olives', '3 tablespoons red wine vinegar', '1 clove garlic, crushed', '1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley', '1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro', '6 to 8 whole wheat or corn tortillas', 'Hot sauce (optional)']","Place the vegetables and beans in a large bowl. Sprinkle the olives over the vegetables. Combine the vinegar, garlic, parsley, and cilantro in a small bowl. Pour over the vegetables and toss to mix.
 Cover and chill for at least 1 hour before serving. To serve, place a line of the vegetable mixture down the center of a tortilla. Drizzle with hot sauce, if desired, roll up, and enjoy."
1817,Fried Potato and Garlic Puffs,"['1 pound russet potatoes', 'Salt', '3 tablespoons unsalted butter', '1/2 cup all-purpose flour', '2 eggs', '1 garlic clove, pounded with a pinch of salt', 'At least 1 quart oil for frying']","Heat the oven to 225¬∞F. Peel the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and cut each half in 3. Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until they‚Äôre completely tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. To check doneness, take a piece out of the pot and cut it at the thickest part. It should sort of break apart and look dry inside. Taste it to be sure, then drain the potatoes well, spread them on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 15 minutes to dry completely.
 Pass them through a sieve or food mill into a medium bowl and set them aside. If you‚Äôll be cooking the puffs as soon as the dough is ready, leave the oven on so that you can keep batches warm as you fry.
 Meanwhile, make the p√¢te √† choux: In a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil with the butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the flour all at once, turn off the heat, and stir with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated. Return the pan to very low heat and stir for a few minutes until the dough forms a ball and a cooked film begins to develop in the saucepan. Let the dough cool for a couple of minutes, and stir in one of the eggs. The dough will fly apart into seemingly irreconcilable blobs, but do not lose heart; keep stirring, and it will become one again, I promise.
 Beat the other egg in a small bowl and begin to stir it in‚Äîyou may not want to add all of it in the interest of dryness. Stop adding egg when the dough becomes elastic, smooth, and shiny, and then stir in the potato and garlic paste and mix thoroughly. The dough will be very sticky.
 In a heavy saucepan or skillet, heat 2 to 3 inches of frying oil to 325¬∞F, or until it is shimmery, not smoking, and a tiny dollop of the dough dropped in sizzles energetically, but does not scare you out of the kitchen. Carefully drop a walnut-size piece of dough into the oil to fry for a taster. Taste and adjust for salt and . . . more garlic? . . . cooked longer? There are two ways to proceed with frying: (1) load the dough into a pastry bag, squeeze out short lengths, and cut them off and into the oil with a knife or scissors, or (2) use two spoons to form and scrape dollops into the oil. Fry the puffs until they‚Äôre golden brown, prodding them with a spider to roll them over and fry the other side as needed.
 Dip them out to drain on a rack or crumpled paper and keep them warm in the oven (without the paper, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using) as you fry the rest.
 Instead of serving the potato puffs alongside fish, meat, chicken, or beans, make them for a pre-dinner aperitivo that you stand around eating in the kitchen while you fry the next batch.
 In spring, if green garlic stalks are available, thinly slice, rinse, and cook one in butter and a very little bit of salted water. When it‚Äôs tender, drain and add it to the mix in place of the pounded garlic.
 Add chopped chives, parsley, or thyme, or Parmesan or other gratable aged cheese to the dough.
 Potato-puff- frying oil can be strained and saved, refrigerated, to reuse for up to a week."
1818,Oysters with Parmesan-Polenta Crust,"['4 large eggs, free-range and organic', '1/2 cup instant polenta', '1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese', '1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt', '1/2 teaspoon ground Espelette pepper or other mild ground chile pepper', '1 quart vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil', '12 freshly shucked oysters', 'Fresh lemon wedges, for garnish', 'A√Øoli piquant or lime mayonnaise', 'for serving']","Place the eggs in a shallow bowl and whisk to blend. In a second shallow bowl, combine the polenta, cheese, salt, and pepper.
 Pour the oil into the saucepan or deep-fryer to a depth of at least 2 inches. If using a deep-fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil, attach it to the side of the saucepan. Heat the oil over medium heat to 375¬∞F, or until a wooden chopstick inserted into the oil begins to fizz with bubbles. Do not be tempted to use too high a heat to bring the oil to temperature, as it will be harder to control and keep stable once you arrive at your goal temperature.
 When the oil has come to temperature, coat the oysters: Dredge the oysters first in the eggs, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl, then in the polenta mixture, shaking off any excess. Arrange on a platter. (The oysters should be fried within just a few moments of coating them.)
 Fry the oysters in batches, about three at a time, until the breading is crisp, firm, and deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with the wire skimmer and transfer to the paper towels to drain. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and a√Øoli or lime mayonnaise."
1819,Honey Brioche,"['1/3 cup whole milk, lukewarm', '1 package (about 2 teaspoons) active dry yeast or instant yeast', '1 tablespoon mild, fragrant honey, such as lavender', '1 large egg, free-range and organic, lightly beaten', '2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour', '1/3 cup mild, fragrant honey, such as lavender', '1 teaspoon fine sea salt', '4 large eggs, free-range and organic, lightly beaten', '1 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour', '3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1 large egg', 'free-range and organic', 'lightly beaten']","In the bowl of the heavy-duty mixer, combine the milk, yeast (see note if using instant yeast), and honey and stir to blend. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and half the flour and stir to blend. The sponge will be soft and sticky. Sprinkle with the remaining flour, to cover the sponge dough, but don‚Äôt mix it in. Set aside to rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes. The sponge should erupt slightly, cracking the layer of flour. This indicates that the yeast is live and doing its job.
 Add the honey, salt, eggs, and flour to the sponge. Mix at low speed just until the ingredients come together, about 1 minute. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes.
 When the butter is incorporated, it should be the same consistency as the dough. To prepare the butter, place it on a flat work surface, and with the pastry scraper, smear it bit by bit across the surface. (If you do not have a pastry scraper, use the back of a large metal spoon.) When it is ready, the butter should be smooth, soft, but still cool‚Äînot warm, oily, or greasy.
 With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time. When all the butter has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium-high for 1 minute, then reduce the speed to medium and continue to beat for 5 minutes more. The dough will be soft and pliable but shouldn‚Äôt stick to your hands.
 Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.
 Punch down the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight, or for at least 4 hours, during which time it should double in size again.
 Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces. Roll each piece of dough tightly into a ball and place 6 pieces in each bread pan, staggering them in two rows of 3; there will be some space left at either end of the loaf but it will fill up when the dough rises again. Cover the pans with a clean cloth and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
 Center a rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.
 Lightly brush the dough with the beaten egg. Working quickly, using the tip of a pair of sharp scissors, snip a cross on the top of each ball of dough; this will help the brioche rise evenly as it bakes. Bake until the loaves are puffed and deeply golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Place the pans on the baking rack to cool. Turn the loaves out after they have cooled.
 When using instant yeast, there is no need to let the yeast proof in warm milk; it can be added directly to the flour. Don‚Äôt omit the milk, however, as this will change the balance of liquid to dry ingredients in the recipe. Instant yeast and active dry yeast can be used interchangeably in the same quantities.
 Honey both enriches the flavor of this brioche and helps keep it moist. Top quality honey makes all the difference here.
 The brioche is best eaten the day it is baked, although it can be tightly wrapped and stored for a day or two or frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature."
1820,Lemon and Elderflower Tart,"['Butter, for greasing', '1 x My Favorite Sweet Shortcrust Pastry recipe', '3 eggs', '125g (2/3 cup) caster (superfine) sugar', 'Zest and juice of 3 unwaxed lemons', '150ml (2/3 cup) heavy cream', '75ml (5 tbsp) elderflower cordial', '""Confectioners sugar', 'to dust""']","Butter a 23cm/9-inch loose-bottomed tart tin, make the pastry, then use it to line the tin and blind bake it according to the instructions. Lower the oven temperature to 340¬∞F/170¬∞C/150¬∞C fan/gas 3.
 Lightly whisk together the eggs, sugar and lemon juice, then add the cream and elderflower cordial. Stir in two-thirds of the lemon zest, reserving the rest for the top. Try to pop any bubbles that appear on the surface with a skewer or skim them off with a spoon.
 Pour half the lemon mixture into the tart case then put it in the oven. Once it is safely in, fill it completely to the top with the rest of the mixture (this half and half approach helps to prevent spillage) then bake for 30‚Äî35 minutes or until the tart has just set. It should still have a slight wobble in the middle.
 Leave the tart to cool completely before removing it from the tin and chilling it in the fridge. To serve, dust with confectioners' sugar and the remaining lemon zest and if you like you can add a big dollop of mascarpone mixed with whipped cream on the side."
1821,Brownie Ice-Cream Sandwich,"['1 x My Favorite Brownie recipe', '200ml (3/4 cup) sweetened condensed milk', '600ml (2 1/2 cups) heavy cream', '1 tsp vanilla bean paste', '100g (3.5-oz) Oreos, or cookie of your choice', 'You will also need two or three 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tins and an electric handheld whisk.']","Line one 20x30cm (8x12-inch) tin with cling film.
 In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, heavy cream, and vanilla using an electric hand-held whisk until the mixture thickens and holds its shape when you take the whisk out. Put the cookies into a plastic bag and bash them with a rolling pin to make crumbs. If you want larger chunks, you could crumble them by hand. Fold the cookie crumbs into the ice-cream mixture, then scrape into the prepared tin. Use a spatula to smooth it out, then freeze for at least two hours or until firm.
 Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F/180¬∞C/160¬∞C fan/gas 4. Make My Favorite Brownie recipe up to step 4, but don't put the mixture in the tin yet.
 Divide the brownie mixture between two lined 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tins (or use one and bake two batches) and use a spatula to spread the batter right into the edges. It will be very thin, as these will be your sandwich layers. Bake each tray for ten minutes, then remove from the oven and leave to cool completely in the tin.
 Remove the brownie layers from the tins and re-line one of the tins with another sheet of baking parchment. Put one brownie layer into the tin, then press the ice-cream layer on the top of it. Add the final layer then return to the freezer for at least 30 minutes.
 Remove the ice-cream sandwich slab from the freezer about ten minutes before serving. Use a sharp knife or pastry cutter to cut shapes‚ÄîI like the effect of a circular cutter."
1822,Peanut Butter and Sour Cherry Cheesecake,"['Butter, for greasing', '75g (about 1/2 cup) dried sour cherries, plus extra for decorating', '1 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar', '1 tsp vanilla bean paste', '1 tbsp kirsch (optional)', '175g digestive biscuits', '25g (about 2 tbsp) salted peanuts, plus extra for decorating', '75g (5 1/4 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted', '400g (about 1 3/4 [8oz] packages) full-fat cream cheese', '150g (3/4 cup) caster (superfine) sugar', '2 egg yolks', '250g (1 cup) heavy cream', '5 leaves gelatin', '150g (1/2 cup) smooth peanut butter', '75g (2.6 ounces) dark chocolate, chopped', '1 tbsp golden syrup', '100ml (about 1/2 cup) double cream', 'A 20cm (8-inch) round springform tin']","Grease a 20cm (8-inch) springform tin and line with baking parchment.
 Put the dried sour cherries into a small saucepan with the sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of water. If you are using kirsch, add this now. Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 4‚Äì5 minutes. The cherries should soften and absorb some of the liquid. Set the pan to one side to cool.
 To make the biscuit base, blitz the digestive biscuits and peanuts in a food processor until they resemble very fine crumbs. Pour the melted butter into the crumbs and blitz again until all the biscuit crumbs are coated in butter. Alternatively, finely chop the peanuts and place into a plastic bag with the biscuits, use a rolling pin to crush them to a fine powder, then put into a bowl and stir in the butter. Tip the crumbs into the base of the prepared tin, then press them down firmly with the back of a teaspoon to make sure they stick together, then chill for at least 30 minutes.
 In a large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, caster sugar and egg yolks until smooth. Stir in the cream until you get a thick but not stiff consistency.
 Soak the gelatin leaves in cold water and allow to soften completely. This will take around five minutes. Melt the smooth peanut butter in the microwave in a medium bowl for about 30 seconds until it is even smoother. Squeeze the gelatin leaves to remove any excess water, then stir into the warm peanut butter until completely dissolved.
 Spoon a few tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into the peanut butter and mix well, before pouring all of the peanut butter mixture into the remaining cream cheese and stirring until completely smooth.
 Drain the cherries then add half to the cream cheese mixture and stir in. Spread onto the prepared biscuit base and use a spatula to smooth the top. Leave to set in the refrigerator, preferably overnight, but for at least four hours.
 When the cheesecake feels firm enough to hold a layer of chocolate (usually after around two hours of chilling), make the chocolate topping. Place the chocolate, golden syrup and cream into a small bowl. Microwave on high for around one minute, removing from the microwave and stirring well every 15 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and no lumps of chocolate remain. Pour over the cheesecake, tilting the tin until the whole top is covered. Decorate with the remaining sour cherries and peanuts. Chill for two hours before serving."

Cut pineapple in half crosswise. Run a knife in a circle around inside of halves 1/2"" away from the skin. Cut across core of pineapple twice, creating 4 pieces and loosening the fruit. Using a big spoon or ice cream scoop, scoop out inside of each pineapple half. Place pineapple ""cups"" in freezer.
 Discard core and finely chop pineapple (you should have about 4 cups). Place in a single layer on a parchment-lined sheet tray and freeze at least 1 hour.
 Blend frozen pineapple, rum, lime juice, 1/3 cup mint, and 2 cups ice in a blender until smooth. Taste and add sugar, if needed.

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla; beat until very fluffy, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until combined (use a large spatula to incorporate any dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl). Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic, pressing down to form into 1/2‚Äù-thick disks. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.
 Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper into a large 1/8""-thick rectangle (about 16x12""), dusting with more flour as needed. Use a knife and a ruler (precision is key) to cut into 4x1 1/2"" rectangles, then use a thin metal spatula to transfer rectangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1"" apart. (If at any point the dough becomes too soft and sticky, slide dough with parchment onto a baking sheet and chill until firm.)
 Chill dough on baking sheet while you repeat the process with the second disk of dough. You should end up with 30 cookies total. Save scraps for another use or discard. Prick cookies in several places with a fork. Bake, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until edges are firm, 12‚Äì15 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Turn half of cookies over.
 Line a 13x9‚Äù baking pan, preferably straight sided, with 2 layers of plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on all sides; place in freezer. Remove both pints of first ice cream flavor from containers (just peel away container if it‚Äôs paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2‚Äù pieces and place in a large bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter. Scrape ice cream into chilled pan and smooth into an even layer with a small off-set spatula. Freeze uncovered until firm, 15‚Äì20 minutes.
 Repeat softening process with both pints of second flavor.
 Scrape second flavor over first layer and smooth out, spreading ice cream all the way to the edges and making top as level as possible. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until ice cream is hard, at least 8 hours.
 Remove ice cream from freezer, unwrap, and invert onto a cutting board; remove pan and peel off plastic. Trim sides of ice cream block to make a neat, straight-edged rectangle measuring 12x7 1/2‚Äù (yep, there‚Äôs that ruler again). Working quickly so ice cream doesn‚Äôt melt, cut block lengthwise into 5 equal rows and then crosswise into thirds so you have 15 pieces measuring about 4x1 1/2‚Äù Working with 1 brick of ice cream at a time, use a thin metal spatula to place on a flat-side-up cookie and top with a right-side up cookie. Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work. Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours. Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.

Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until chiles are softened, 20‚Äì25 minutes. Drain.
 Remove seeds from chiles; discard. Remove tops from radishes and coarsely chop. Thinly slice radishes and set aside for the salad. Combine chiles, radish tops, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, honey, and paprika in a blender; season with salt and pepper. Blend until chiles are finely chopped. With the motor running, stream in oil; blend until dressing is emulsified and smooth.
 Prepare a grill for high heat. Cover the underside of a large cast-iron skillet with 2 layers of foil and set on grate (you want it to have time to get very hot).
 Working one at a time, butterfly squid bodies. Cut a slit from wide opening to pointed end of body and open up into a flat triangle. Remove the thin clear sliver of cartilage; discard. Using the back of your knife, scrape away the jellylike membrane lining the inside of the body. Rinse bodies and tentacles well; pat dry with paper towels.
 Combine garlic, mayonnaise, vinegar, several pinches of salt, and a few cranks of pepper in a large plastic resealable bag. Add squid, seal bag, pressing out air, and massage to coat squid in marinade. Chill 30 minutes.
 Lightly oil grate (grate must be clean, so give it a scrub with a wire brush before oiling if needed). Remove squid from bag, letting marinade drip off. Place a few pieces flat on grate and immediately set hot skillet on top (you want to work in a small enough area and with few enough pieces that the skillet covers all the squid at once). Grill until marks appear, about 45 seconds, then uncover squid and turn over (pieces will curl a bit). Set skillet back on top and grill until marks appear on second side, about another 45 seconds. Transfer squid to a medium bowl. Continue with remaining squid.
 Add lemon juice to bowl with squid and season with a bit more salt; toss to coat. If bodies are very large, cut into smaller pieces; transfer to a platter. Drizzle several tablespoonfuls of dressing over (reserve the rest for serving with grilled meats or scrambled eggs).

Pour contents of chimney onto one side of grill. Arrange 3 chunks of wood or a handful of chips next to, not on top of, coals. (Placing them on top of the coals will cause them to burn too quickly; you want the wood to catch slowly and smolder.) Place grate on grill and cover grill, positioning vent on lid as far from heat source as possible. (This will help draw the smoke up and over the meat as it rises.)
 If using a gas grill, prepare grill for medium-low indirect heat, leaving one or two burners off. Place wood chips in smoker box and set over direct heat; cover grill.
 Stick an ovenproof probe thermometer through top vent if your grill has one. Heat until thermometer registers around 275¬∞F, adjusting vents on bottom and top of grill or control knobs as needed to maintain temperature. Get any high-heat grilling done while you wait for the temperature to drop.
 Meanwhile, mix paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chile powder, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Arrange wings on a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle half of rub over top. Turn over and sprinkle remaining rub over other side. Let sit at room temperature until grill is ready.
 Place wings on grill over indirect heat, leaving a small gap between each piece to allow smoke to circulate. Smoke wings, replenishing wood as needed (and adding a coal or two of charcoal as needed), until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165¬∞F, 1 1/2‚Äì2 hours (as long as smoke is circulating well in grill, you shouldn‚Äôt need to turn wings).
 Just before wings are done, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and molasses and cook, stirring, until heated through; season with salt. Toss wings in sauce in a large bowl just before serving."
1839,Butterflied Chicken with Herbs and Cracked Olives,"['2 (3 1/2‚Äì4)-pound chickens, backbones removed', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '6 garlic cloves, finely grated', '1/4 cup Aleppo-style pepper', '1/4 cup finely chopped rosemary', '1/2 cup olive oil, divided', '1 cup Castelvetrano or other green olives, pitted, torn', '1/4 cup fresh lemon juice', '1/4 cup chopped oregano', '1/2 cup chopped parsley', 'plus leaves for serving']","The night before you plan to grill the chickens, place them on a work surface, breast side up, and open them up against the surface as much as possible. Using your palms, press firmly on breastbone to flatten breast. You may hear a crack. This means you‚Äôre doing it right. Set chickens, breast side up, on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season generously on both sides with salt and black pepper. Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.
 Remove chickens from refrigerator and set out on your counter. Combine garlic, Aleppo-style pepper, rosemary, and 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl.

1844,"Breakfast Pizza with Sausage, Eggs, Spinach, and Cream","['1 ball of homemade or store-bought pizza dough (about 1-pound/304 g)', '3 ounces (85 g) fresh mozzarella, pinched into small chunks', '2 cups (220 g) shredded low-moisture mozzarella', '2 or 3 handfuls baby spinach', '1 large clove garlic, chopped or very thinly sliced', '1/2 cup (70 g) fresh sausage', '1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream', 'Fine sea salt', '2 large eggs', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives', 'Crushed red pepper flakes', 'Extra-virgin olive oil', '3 tablespoons grated hard cheese']","Place your stone on the lowest shelf of your oven, then turn your oven to its highest temperature. Most ovens go to 500¬∞F (260¬∞C) and some to 550¬∞F (287¬∞C). Heat your stone for at least one hour before baking.
 If you‚Äôre taking your dough out of the fridge, give it about 15 minutes or so to warm up a bit so it will be easier to work with. It should have doubled in size in the fridge. If it hasn‚Äôt, let it sit at room temperature, covered with a slightly damp towel, until it does.
 Lightly flour your counter and your hands. Flip the dough into the flour bowl so the top side of the dough ball gets dusted first. Flip it once more, making sure that the dough is completely coated. Press the dough down into the flour, then pick it up and place it on the floured countertop.
 Pressing your fingers firmly into the dough, start by flattening the center and work your way out toward the edge to make it wider, until it‚Äôs about 7 to 9 inches (17 to 23 cm) wide. Pushing down on the dough will release some of the gas and actually begin opening up the dough. Be careful not to disturb the outermost lip. This will eventually become your crust.
 The next step is a bit tricky. Your goal is to take this disc of dough and carefully stretch it to about 14 to 16 inches (35.5 to 40.5 cm) without tearing it or creating a hole. I pick it up with floured hands and begin to gently stretch it over my fists, letting gravity do most of the work.
 Once you‚Äôve stretched it enough, put the dough back on the counter, making sure there is a generous dusting of flour underneath. Take a few generous pinches of semolina flour and dust your pizza peel. Make sure it‚Äôs coated evenly. Gently lift and transfer your dough to the peel. Make sure both your hands and the peel are well-floured. You are now ready to dress your pie.
 Start by adding both mozzarellas to the dough, followed by the spinach and garlic. Add the sausage. Top with the cream and season with salt. Transfer to the oven. Bake for 3 minutes, then open the oven, pull out the rack with the baking stone, crack the eggs into the center of the pizza, and season them with salt and pepper. Push the rack back into the oven, close the door, and finish baking.
 The crust will rise significantly. Then change the oven setting from bake to broil, cooking the pizza from the top down until the crust begins to blister. The residual heat of the stone will continue to cook the bottom. (If your broiler is at the bottom of your oven, skip this step and continue to bake the pizza as described.) I cook all my pizzas until they‚Äôre well done, which could take up to 10 minutes total (sometimes less). Just keep checking so you don‚Äôt burn it. Look for the cheese to color and the crust to turn deep brown. It may blacken in spots, and that‚Äôs okay.
 When the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and finish with the chives, a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, and the grated hard cheese."

Place steak in a large resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over, and toss to coat. Marinate, tossing occasionally, at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or chill overnight.
 If chilled, let steak sit at room temperature 30 minutes. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120‚Äì125¬∞F for medium-rare, 2‚Äì3 minutes per side for skirt; 3‚Äì4 minutes per side for flank.

Once the burgers start to cook, you will need them quickly. Divide the meat into 10 even portions. Roll each one into a meatball about the size of a ping-pong ball.
 Dice the onion medium-fine and place in a small bowl. Add warm salted water just to cover and set beside the stove. Heat a skillet over high heat until very hot. If you have an infrared thermometer, the skillet should register at least 500¬∞F (250¬∞C). Or test by brushing on a bit of oil. When the skillet starts to smoke, it is ready.
 While the skillet is heating, working one at a time, flatten a meatball slightly and sprinkle it liberally on both sides with kosher salt. Salt drives much of this recipe. Brush oil onto the skillet and place the flattened ball on it. Just after it hits the pan, flip it over and using a solid, reinforced metal spatula, press hard to flatten it. You want it really thin. Do this just once, while the meat is still cold.
 After the burger has sizzled for about 30 to 40 seconds, top with about a tablespoon (15 g) of the watery onions. This will produce a good amount of onion fumes. That‚Äôs okay. Spread the water and onions as evenly as you can and press them gently into the meat; don‚Äôt squish down hard.
 Wait another 30 seconds and taking great care to lift the meat from the pan with its crust intact, flip it over. Immediately put a slice of cheese on the meat and a bottom bun on top of the cheese. Wait another 10 to 15 seconds and remove onto a top bun. Invert onto serving platter and repeat to make 10 sliders. Serve with condiments of your choice."

Reduce the heat, stir in the pieces of lemon zest, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir, and remove and discard the pieces of lemon zest. Allow the quinoa to cool slightly.
 Meanwhile, put a large pot of water on the stove to boil, drop the asparagus and snow peas into the boiling water, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until crisp-tender (do not overcook; the vegetables should still be slightly firm). Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon and drop into a bowl of ice water. Drain. Combine the cooked quinoa, asparagus, snow peas, kohlrabi, and radishes in a large bowl.

Add one-third of the dry mixture to the liquid and blend it in on low speed. Beat in half of the sour cream, followed by another third of the dry mixture, the rest of the sour cream, and the remaining dry mixture. The batter will start to get heavier late in the mixing, and you may want to do the last bit of mixing with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.
 Lift the zucchini out of the colander and give it a gentle squeeze, but don‚Äôt squeeze out all the moisture. Add the zucchini to the batter and fold it in with a rubber spatula until evenly mixed. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth with a spoon.

When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whip until the sides of the bowl feel only slightly warm and the mixture is thick and glossy. Add the vanilla extract at the end. This icing is easiest to pipe when it is warm, so transfer immediately to a piping bag fitted with a large circular nozzle or with the tip cut off.
 To assemble, use a sharp knife or specialist cupcake corer to make a circular incision in the center of each cupcake, remove the center and fill each one with a teaspoon of the chocolate filling.
 Pipe a large mound of marshmallow topping on the top of each cupcake, covering the chocolate filling. Use a blowtorch, if you have one, to lightly brown each one, avoiding the paper case as this will burn. You could use the broiler to brown the marshmallow topping, but watch carefully because it is more difficult to control the color and prevent it burning.
 To finish, chop the chocolate squares finely and sprinkle over the top of the marshmallow."
1872,Peach and Pomegranate Pavlova,"['1 x My Favorite Meringue recipe', '2 tbsp freeze-dried raspberries, crushed to a fine powder', '300ml (1 1/4 cups) heavy cream', '4 ripe peaches, pitted and thinly sliced', '1 pomegranate', 'deseeded']","Preheat the oven to 250¬∞F/120¬∞C/100¬∞C fan/the lowest gas mark and line a baking sheet with baking parchment or a reusable baking sheet.
 Make the meringue mixture then sprinkle the raspberry powder over the top and fold through a few times. You want to see ripples of raspberry, so don‚Äôt mix it in completely. Spoon onto the baking sheet and spread it out into a large rectangle that is the same thickness all over. Bake for three hours so the meringue is completely dried out and crisp. To ensure a crunchy shell and soft, chewy middle, I like to turn the oven off and leave the meringue to cool in the oven overnight. If you don‚Äôt have time, just leave it to cool on the tray until completely cold.
 Whip the cream into soft peaks and just before serving, spoon it onto the top of the meringue. Arrange the peach slices on top of the cream, fanning them out, then sprinkle the pomegranate seeds on top."
1873,Traditional Sauerkraut with Caraway,"['2 green cabbages (about 2 kg/4 lb 6 oz), shredded', '50 g (1 3/4 oz) fine ground salt (about 2.5%)', '15 g (1/2 oz) caraway seeds (optional)', '2 L (68 fl oz) jar', 'pounder (a heavy implement like the end of a rolling pin', 'potato masher', 'or cocktail muddler)', 'follower (a whole cabbage leaf or small plate)', 'weight (see note)']","Weigh the shredded cabbage (as cabbages vary in size and weight) to ensure the salt to cabbage ratio is correct. The amount of salt you use should come to about 1.5‚Äì2.5%, but no more than 3%, of the cabbage weight.
 In a large bowl, mix and massage the salt through the cabbage thoroughly, making sure to distribute the salt evenly.
 Let it sit to sweat a bit‚Äîmaybe 10 minutes. This is simply to make the next step easier. This is a good time to get your vessel cleaned and to rest up for the next stage.
 With your pounder, pound quite energetically for about 5‚Äì10 minutes, until the cabbage is dripping with its own salty water when you pick up a handful. This part is important as you need this liquid‚Äîit‚Äôs your brine.
 You can also use the dough hook of a stand mixer to do the pounding part, which can speed things up somewhat. Don‚Äôt let it run for too long though, only a few minutes. Using a mixer is easy and great for people who are doing this a lot and in large batches, but it takes quite a bit of the emotional release and fun out of it.
 Next, mix in the caraway seeds (if using).
 Put the mixture into the jar, packing it down tightly as you go using the pounder. Push down well, particularly at the end to coax out any more brine. You need the brine to cover the cabbage.
 Don‚Äôt pack the cabbage all the way to the top; leave some headroom at the top of the jar to allow for a bit of growth and movement and, of course, the weight. You don‚Äôt want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.
 Cover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.
 Depending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you‚Äôd like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better. It is ready when you think it is delicious. With the right system and temperature, you can leave it to ferment for months before refrigeration.
 If you used a crock, you‚Äôll need to decant the kraut to smaller jars before you refrigerate, unless you have a walk-in cool room, or large cellar. (Lucky you.) It will keep in the fridge for 12 months or more. Use your senses."

Spread two-thirds of the sugar-flour mixture on the bottom of the crust, leaving a 2-inch border around the edge. Place two-thirds of the peaches over the flour mixture. Sprinkle the remaining flour mixture over the peaches. Add the remaining peaches on top. Fold the outer edge of the pastry dough in over the crostata to create a crust, pinching excess dough to secure.
 Leaving the crostata on the parchment paper, transfer to a baking sheet. Sprinkle the sliced almonds on top and bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 50 minutes.

In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the Earth Balance and pulse for about 15 seconds (it will look like coarse meal). Slowly pour 1/4 cup water into the mixture and pulse until the dough is moist and holds together when pinched. If it‚Äôs too dry, add a little more water.
 Flour a clean work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Divide into two balls, rolling one out into a 12-inch circle, starting from the center and rolling outward. Place into the pie pan and pinch together the edges of the crust around the pan. Roll out the second ball of dough into a 12-inch circle and either cut into long strips or keep as is."

Season salmon lightly with salt and place in bag. Seal bag and turn salmon to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours (go the full time for the most flavor).
 Prepare a grill for medium heat. You want moderate heat for fatty fish like salmon so the fat can slowly render while the skin gets nice and crisp. Clean grate well with a wire brush. Just before you set salmon on the grill, fold up a paper towel and hold it with a pair of long tongs. Dip paper towel in oil and wipe down grate.
 Remove salmon from tare, letting excess drip back into bag; discard tare in bag. Grill salmon, skin side down, brushing occasionally with reserved 1/4 cup tare, until skin is lightly charred and crisp, 5‚Äì7 minutes.

Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin. Cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and saut√© for another minute, stirring constantly. Add the rinsed quinoa and water, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don‚Äôt worry).
 Remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Gently stir in the black beans and salt. Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.
 In a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.
 In a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water. Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalape√±o, garlic, and salt. Process until the dressing is nice and smooth. The dressing should be zippy, but if it‚Äôs unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.
 Combine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl. Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed. (If you won‚Äôt be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you‚Äôd like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)
 When you‚Äôre ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra). Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.
 Arrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side). Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta. Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad. Serve immediately.
 If you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later. Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers."

 Shortly before you‚Äôd like to bake the tofu, preheat the oven to 400¬∞F. If this is the only thing you‚Äôre making, use a toaster oven‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect size. Remove the tofu slices from the marinade and transfer to a parchment-lined baking pan in a single layer. If you‚Äôre using the full-size oven, roast some veggies at the same time (I like to use the excess marinade to roast eggplant or green beans).
 Bake for 20 minutes, then turn the strips and bake for 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until the tofu is firm and starting to turn light brown along the edges.
 Add 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (or more to taste) to the marinade for a subtle smoky flavor.
 Instead of baking, cook these tofu slices on a grill. About 5 minutes per side should do‚Äîmake sure there are nice grill marks on each side."

1895,Chocolate Glaze,"['3/4 cup heavy cream', '1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon powdered instant espresso or coffee', '1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips']","Bring the cream to a near boil in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla or espresso powder. Immediately add the chocolate chips. Tilt the pan this way and that so the hot cream runs over them. Set the pan aside for 5 minutes, then stir the mixture briefly to start smoothing it out.
 Let the mixture rest for another 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk briefly, until smooth. The glaze will be a little runny at first, perfect for drizzling on pound cakes and Bundt-type cakes. If you want slightly thicker coverage, such as on a cheesecake or sheet cake, you can let the glaze cool slightly before spreading it. If the sauce cools and starts to thicken and you need to rewarm it to thin it out, heat it very gently in a saucepan. You can also reheat it in a microwavable container, but proceed carefully so you don‚Äôt burn the chocolate‚Äîmicrowave for no more than 15 seconds at a time, stirring between each round."

 Take a slice of the macaroni and cheese, and, handling it gently, coat both sides in the flour. Then dunk both sides in the egg. Finally, coat both sides with the bread crumbs, pressing the mixture so it sticks. Set aside the slice and repeat with the remaining slices.
 Coat both sides of the waffle iron grid with nonstick spray. Place the macaroni and cheese slices in the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook until heated through and golden brown, 3 minutes.
 The extraction process can be tricky. With a silicone spatula, loosen the edges of the macaroni and cheese. Use the spatula to gently pry the macaroni and cheese from the waffle iron and then support the bottom with the spatula while you lift it out with tongs.
 Repeat Steps 5 through 7 until all of the macaroni and cheese has been waffled. Keep the finished macaroni and cheese warm in the oven."

Stir continuously and break up any lumps of sugar‚Äîthis will help the sugar caramelize evenly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring with a spatula to dissolve the sugar, then simmer, without stirring, until the caramel turns the color of a copper penny (or an Irish setter), about 4 minutes. If, while the caramel cooks, any sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, brush down the sides with a clean, wet pastry brush. Reduce the heat to low, and slowly add 1/2 cup of the cream (the caramel will rise and bubble and might spit, so be careful). Stir until the cream is well incorporated into the caramel.

While whisking, add a splash of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks. Continue to add the dairy mixture, whisking it in bit by bit, until you‚Äôve added about half. Add the yolk mixture to the remaining dairy mixture in the double boiler, and stir in the caramel. Set the heat under the double boiler to medium and cook the custard, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and reducing the heat to medium-low as necessary, until steam begins to rise from the surface and the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally and run your finger through the custard.

Grease three 18cm (7 inch) cake tins and line with parchment paper.
 Put the butter, sugars, flour, baking powder, malt powder and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low until all the butter is rubbed into the dry mixture and it has a sandy texture. Alternatively, rub the butter into the dry ingredients by hand, as if you were making pastry.
 In a small jug, beat together the milk, eggs and vanilla. Pour the mixture down the side of the bowl into the dry ingredients and beat until everything is mixed together. When all the liquid has been added, beat on a high speed for two minutes until it is well combined and smooth. Alternatively, you could use an electric hand-held whisk.
 Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins and bake in the preheated oven for 25‚Äì30 minutes until golden brown. The cake will look slightly darker than you might expect with the added malted milk powder, so be more vigilant in checking that it is ready.
 Heat the milk and malted milk powder in a small saucepan. Whisk until all the lumps of powder have dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. Set aside to cool. Beat the butter in a large bowl until smooth, then gradually add the icing sugar and cool malted milk paste. Use an electric hand-held whisk to beat the buttercream for 5‚Äì10 minutes until light and fluffy. It should hold its shape but still be fairly soft.
 To assemble the cake, stack the bottom two layers on top of each other and use a circular 9cm cutter to remove the middle. Press through both layers at once to make sure the holes line up.
 Put the bottom ring on a cake stand and cover the top with a layer of buttercream using a palette knife. Try not to get icing too close to the middle, because moisture on the sweets will cause them to become sticky.
 Put the second ring on top of the first and fill the hole with milk bottle sweets. Make sure it is filled to the same level as the sponge or the top sponge will cave in. Cover the second ring with buttercream then add the final sponge. Thinly cover the whole cake with some of the buttercream to trap any crumbs, then chill for a minimum of 30 minutes.
 Cover the cake with the remaining buttercream, placing a large dollop on the top to create a swirl. Decorate using more milk bottle sweets and coloured paper straws."

On a hot griddle pan or in a cast-iron skillet, grill the onion until tender. Separate into rings and chop very fine.
 Lightly brush a 7 1/2 X 11-inch baking dish with olive oil and preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.
 In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped grilled onion, lamb, pork, mustard, garlic, coriander, espelette, fresh herbs, scallion, and eggs. Season liberally with kosher salt and pepper and thoroughly combine the mixture with clean hands. Transfer to the baking dish and spread out evenly to the edges, smoothing the top flat. Place the dish inside a larger roasting pan and add boiling water to about halfway up the sides of the baking dish.
 Bake for 45 minutes, or until the gyro shrinks away from the sides and is quite hot in the middle when pierced with a metal skewer (around 150¬∞F). Remove the pan from the water bath and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or, ideally, 24 hours, to develop the flavors.
 Place a large, flat platter upside down over the baking dish. Turn both over, and carefully remove the gyro. With a hot, sharp knife, slice the gyro about 3/8 inch thick. In a very large skillet, warm 1/3 cup oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, add the gyro slices and saut√© for about 2 minutes, shaking the pan around to thoroughly coat the slices with the oil.
 Paint the pita with extra-virgin olive oil, season with kosher salt and pepper, and grill until firm and char-marked on all sides. Smear some Tzatziki in the center of each pita round. Divide the gyro meat among the pitas, on top of the tzatziki. Add some Greek Salad. Pull the sides of the pita up to meet in the center, like a taco.

1974,Cooked Semi-Polished Rice (Haiga Mai),"['1 cup Japanese-style semi-polished rice', '1 cup plus 3 tablespoons water, soft tap or filtered', '1 1/2 cups Japanese-style semi-polished rice', 'Generous 1 3/4 cups', 'soft tap or filtered water']","As already noted, great care must be taken when washing partially polished rice to avoid dislodging the nutrient-rich germ. Place the rice in a deep bowl and pour in enough cool tap water just to cover the grains. Using your fingertips in gentle swirling, swishing motions, rinse the grains for about 15 seconds. With slightly scooping motions, gently lift the grains once or twice, to ensure that water flows freely around each grain. Drain the rice. Use your hand or a fine-mesh strainer to hold back the rice as you drain off the water. Some people find it useful to line their strainer with fine-woven cloth (the Japanese use sarashi) or a clean, low-lint kitchen towel. Carefully transfer the rice to a pot or rice-cooker bowl.
 Place the washed and drained rice in a sturdy, straight-sided pot. A 2- or 3-quart size will work well for the two smaller quantities, and a 4- to 6-quart pot is appropriate for the larger amount. Add the water. Ideally, the rice should sit in its measured water for 10 minutes before cooking, but if you are pressed for time, add a few extra drops of water and cook right away. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.
 Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. You will hear bubbling noises and see the lid begin to dance after several minutes. An onomatopoeic folk jingle that describes the cooking of rice refers to this bubbling stage as choro choro. Reduce the heat and continue to cook until the water is absorbed (about 5 minutes). You will know this point has been reached when you hear a low hissing sound (the folk jingle calls this naka pappa). If it is difficult to rely on the sound of the cooking and you must check visually on progress along the way, peek quickly, replacing the lid immediately.
 Increase the heat to high again for 30 seconds to dry off the rice. Remove the pot from the heat and let the rice stand, still tightly covered, for at least 10 minutes. Even if you wish to serve the rice piping hot, these final minutes of self-steaming (called murasu) are necessary to achieve the proper texture.
 Place the washed and drained rice in the bowl of your cooker. Add the water. It is important to use cool liquid when cooking rice in a thermostatically controlled appliance; using warm or hot liquid from the start will cut short the cooking cycle. Close the lid, press the start switch, and let the appliance do the cooking. The time required to complete the cooking cycle will vary with the appliance, but most models take about 40 minutes to cook 1 to 1 1/2 cups raw rice."

Saut√© for an additional 1‚Äì2 minutes. Plate the onions, scallions, and dill on a serving platter.Remove fish from bowl, drain, and dispose of marinade.

If you have delicious skin-on fish, give some extra cooking love to that skin, which should turn nice and crispy before you flip it.Plate the fish on saut√©ed onions, scallions, and dill. Garnish with remaining fresh dill and scallions, cucumber, Pickled Red Onions, and peanuts.Serve immediately with sides of vermicelli noodles, Coco Rico Vietnamese Fish Sauce, and butter lettuce. Wrap everything, eat everything in a bowl, or whatever combination makes you happy. (I and many Vietnamese especially like it with ‚ÄúMam Nem‚Äù, a fermented fish and pineapple dipping sauce‚Äîdon‚Äôt knock it til you try it!) Enjoy one of my favoritest dishes evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!"
